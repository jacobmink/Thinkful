Grade: A+\\n\\nImma be blunt: Fellas, stop wasting your time & money on talentless hacks (the 99.9% of people who cut hair) & make this guy your regular.\\n\\nThis guy puts everyone else in the haircutting game to shame. Male, female, gay, straight, black, white, young or old...they all suck compared to this Italian-American dude. He is a true artist & even has a mini-statue of Michelangelo\\'s David next to the chair (a very cool reclining chair) for inspiration or as a reminder that you\\'re going to be walking out of there looking like a masterpiece.\\n\\nCalled ahead on rainy Saturday & left with the best haircut I\\'ve had in years. Hip but not hipster, classic handsome good-looking cut. All done with minimal direction from me (take the sides & back in, comb the front forward & give it some height). I went home, inspected his work & it was flawless 360! Not one missed spot (usually, for me, behind the ears), & not one follicle left untended.\\n\\nIncredible attention to detail, very friendly intelligent funny guy (when he was done, he said, \"Well, I\\'ve done enough damage to you...What do you think?\"), good conversation & casual vibes, all for $14...\\n\\nJust. \\nPerfect.\\n\\n#ItaliansDoItBetter\\n\\nI am King of All Bad Haircuts no more.\\n\\n#Freedom'],\n",

Seriously, for $15 bucks it doesn't get much better than that. Get down to Bloomfield and experience it for yourself. The true Italian way.\"],\n",
       " [5,\n",
       "  u'Great haircut, even better atmosphere.\\n\\nTom is an excellent barber and is clearly a fixture of the neighborhood.  Not only was he on a first name basis with almost all of his customers, it seems pretty clear that they have all been loyal for years.  I wandered in here when my (now former) regular guy was closed between Christmas and New Year\\'s, and the awesome old-school charm of the Golden Razor has won me over.  It is definitely best to call ahead for an appointment, but he was able to squeeze me into his busy schedule same day.  I don\\'t actually know how much he charges for a haircut because I just gave him a $20 bill and said thanks - I\\'m assuming from other reviews, though, that he charges around $15 for a regular cut.\\n\\n\"How is the Golden Razor old school,\" you ask?  In addition to Tom\\'s obvious skills and the nice touch of using a straight razor on the back of the neck, there was a self-serve open bar and a stack of Playboys in the corner.  Johnny Walker Red and soda while you wait for a haircut?  Not a bad way to go!\\n\\nDo yourself a favor and check out the Golden Razor - Tom knows what he\\'s doing and all of the other positive reviews are on the money.'],\n",

As I learned from the other people walking in and out, the barber's name is Tom, older gentleman with an Italian accent. He's def from the old country. Very friendly dude with a funny personality. The wait was only about a half hour, which isn't bad at all for a walk in on a Saturday afternoon (I've waited at other barber shops for over an hour and a half when just walking in). \\n\\nAs for the actual hair cut, I'm really satisfied with it. Tom was quick and efficient. I could tell he's been cutting hair for a long time by the way he works. Real quality stuff. I like the fact that he uses a straight razor on the neckline.\\n\\nNo lie, probably one of the best hair cuts I've gotten in a while. I will def be back to see Tom the next time I need a hair cut.\"],\n",

Decided to give Tom at Golden Razor a try after reading some of the other reviews and am happy I did.  He did a great job and gave me exactly the cut I needed.  I had made an afternoon reservation and I was in the chair within just a couple minutes of our scheduled time. Tom was pleasant and quick, but not rushed.  I will definitely be going back!'],\n",
       " [5,\n",
       "  u\"I've been going to see Tom at Golden Razor for the past four or five years after a long and fruitless search to find a decent place in Pittsburgh that won't leave me poor. He's not a stylist, so don't go looking for whatever you find in the latest GQ. He is, however, a damn good barber, so if you showed him a picture of what you wanted, I'm confident he could pull it off. \\n\\nTom's old school-- thick Italian accent. He's been at his Bloomfield location since '97 and before that, over 25 years in East Liberty (when the neighborhood was a sh*thole and not the resurgent place it now is).  Tom remembers the regulars by name-- asks how you are, generally remembers what you've been up to, and asks how your family is doing. He does appointments alongside walk-ins. I've never left disappointed in a haircut and have money left over, even after a handsome (and well-deserved) tip. In sum, Tom's place is what a barber shop ought to be: plenty of magazines, great conversation and simple, inexpensive haircuts.\\n\\nP.S. He's busy on Saturday mornings as one might expect. Schedule ahead of time, or enjoy the time just hanging out. Also, cash only.\"],\n",

I\\'ve gotten so many compliments about my haircut that it makes me not want to go anywhere else.  I think he does a fantastic job at a great price.  \\n\\nDude is busy and for a very good reason.  I would definitely call in for an appointment.  If you walk in, it\\'ll probably best in the morning.   Otherwise, you  might be waiting a bit.  \\n\\nWe shared drinks, talk about life, work, sports, news, etc.  He\\'s on a first name basis with many of his clients.  He calls me \"doc\" every time I come in because of my scrubs.\\n\\nThe place has an old school vibe to it though I do see guys of all ages go here.  Tom has paintings on the wall that he painted himself.  He has pictures of his family, kids, and grandkids. He has boxes of toys in the waiting area.  TV is always in the background playing the news.  It\\'s a homely place.\\n\\nI don\\'t know what else to say.  Dude knows how to cut hair and a friendly guy.

The first haircut that got me yelping was good butremember I was king of all bad haircuts at the time so I really had no sense of style back then. Month after month, it all went downhill as the cuts got shorter and shorter, blander & boring-er. \\n\\nAt first I thought he didn't like me but then I saw another young dude get another quick too-short-&-out-the-door cut like mine so I realized it's just how he sees young men's hair. The Dude Just Got Old & Complacent & needs to retire or just cut hair in a mortuary. \\n\\nThis place represents the old world - ignorance, corruption, favoritism, etc. Do yourself a favor & go a stones throw away in lower Lawrenceville to Mister Grooming & Goods to get treated like a king & get an awesome cut for just a few dollars more than this DOA place.\\n\\nTrust me, you'll be glad you did.\"],\n",

       "  u\"I'm a pretty hard core karaoke fan, so I was excited to visit Nico's on a Saturday night after hearing about their awesome karaoke. Sadly, I was disappointed. The place is rather small and was packed by the time we came (about 10pm). It took ages to get a drink and it's hard to get around the bar with so many people standing around. That said, my drink was nice and strong and the prices are reasonable. \\n\\nNow the karaoke crowd was pretty fun...mostly hipsters with a few good singers but mostly people trying to be funny with their song choice. The karaoke host was just lame. He was an older guy, and seemed rather cranky and jaded, which really kills the mood when you're a karaoke buff looking for a good time. And he had a CD setup -- seriously, CDs, in 2010. His song list was waaaaaay out of date. He had a tiny TV screen that was setup in such a way that if you needed to look at the words, you would be facing away from the crowd. It was just really lackluster in my opinion.\"],\n",

       "  u\"Nico's is one of my favorite Yinzer bars.  I've been going here off and on since I turned 21, even if it was just to stop in for fries at lunch, and it's one of the finest dives around.\\n\\nWe typically stop in here for a fish sandwich and some drinks after the Unblurred gallery crawl in Garfield.  Jason bartends on Friday nights, and he's the best.  He's one of those bartenders that remembers you after your first visit, and remembers what you drink and keeps the refills coming.\\n\\nTheir food is excellent.  The fish sandwich is church-fish-fry good, and the coleslaw is crispy and mayonnaise-d to perfection.  But the real treat of this place is the fries.  There's something about these fries that I just love.  I think they remind me of the homemade fries my grandpa used to make me in his deep fryer when I was a kid.  They're kind of like a thinner, jucy-er version of Potato Patch fries.  Seriously.  Go get some now.\\n\\nAnd like other dive bars in Pittsburgh, the prices are cheap.  This is the perfect place to sit around with your fellow Yinzers and watch the Buccos or the Pens (or both, if it's that glorious time of year when both seasons are going - they have multiple TVs).\\n\\nThe only thing I don't like about Nico's is that it's one of the few smoking-permitted bars left in town (they, like Thunderbird and the Cage, keep the food prices low to skirt that smoking ban loophole).  I've gotten kind of spoiled lately by smoke-free establishments, and I hate coming home stinking like cigarettes.\\n\\nBut the dives in Pittsburgh are all pretty much maintaining the smoking thing, so I can't complain when comparing.

It's something like 24 wings for 8 bucks which is not a bad deal. There are definitely better wings around the city, but I still keep coming back to Nico's. Maybe it has to do with the friendly atmosphere (seems to be a family run place), and the divey feel. The location is great as it just pops up in the middle of a residential section in the heart of Bloomfield.\\n\\nThe patrons are always friendly, and on more than one occasion I've had random people start chatting me up like we've known each other for years. If you are feeling adventurous try out karaoke night on Saturdays, its always good for some laughs and fun times.\\n\\nLong live the old school joints in Pittsburgh, I hope you last forever.\"],\n",

Wednesdays are pizza and a pitcher -- we LOVE the Chili Pie and pair it up with Yuengling or the similar.

Generally in the late afternoon/early evening it is pretty quiet, with a handful or two of regulars.  A reading group that I am in frequently meets here around happy hour, and there are always plenty of tables and we can talk easily without having to yell.  Weekends it can get pretty crowded, although I've never seen it so packed that I had to wait more than a couple of minutes to grab a bartender's attention.

This is one cool dive bar, which in one room has a full 360 bar and the other room a bunch of tables and booths for sittin' and singin'! I've been here more than a dozen times and have always had a blast. I know it's not everybody's cup of tea, but there is no funner night that grabbing some pitchers with a group of friends and making a fool out of yourself behind a mic. And this is the perfect place for it. By no means is this a place for upscale cocktails with the coworkers: we're talkin cheap beer, (really!) smokey, loud, and just a damn good time! One the many reasons I was excited to move to Friendship Park was to be within stumbling distance of Nico's. Whether it is after work or a late night hangout with peeps, this has become my neighborhood dive bar and it perfectly encapsulates the spirit of Pittsburgh.\"],\n",

       " [5,\n",
       "  u\"I'm shocked there are so few reviews for Donatelli's.  In reading the few reviews here, it seems people either love it or hate it.  Yes, it's an older building that might not be spotless and is overflowing with so much product that you can barely move around.  But it also gives me a comforting feeling, like the store is a blanket I want to wrap around myself.\\n\\nSpeaking of comfort, their foods are worth the visit.  They have good meats and cheeses at the deli as well as hot food items (one of these days I will get that fish sandwich).  Not hungry right now?  Check out all their frozen pasta items.  On my most recent visit, I picked up a 2 foot hoagie for $6.99, mostly because it was a great deal but also because sometimes I want someone else to make me a sandwich (and they used those good meats and cheeses from their deli).  Don't forget to pick up some bakery items on your way out.  I highly recommend the biscotti.\\n\\nBottom line: If you're wandering around Bloomfield looking for some unexpected surprises, there's no shortage and if you stop in Donatelli's you won't be disappointed.\"],\n",
       " [5,\n",
       "  u\"I've now been to Donatelli's multiple times, and have sampled several of their products, so I feel that I can review it comprehensively. Overall, I've been pleased with most of their products, the prices, and the customer service and atmosphere, hence the 4-star rating.\\n\\nAs others have mentioned, the space is rather cramped and chaotic, esp. during peak business hours (e.g., Sat. around noon, when I last stopped in).  The layout when you walk in is a bit strange, to the point that I inadvertently ended up behind the counter on my first visit.  (Stay to the left and you won't have this problem.)  The most crowded section of the store is the deli counter, where you can obtain not only meats and cheeses, but a variety of made-to-order sandwiches and sides.  If you visit the deli counter during peak hours and are feeling indecisive, take a number right away--trust me, you'll have plenty of time to decide what to get as others are being helped.\\n\\nAs for the grocery products, there is enough variety that you can find several versions of most Italian ingredients you'll need here, as well as other general grocery items like milk and ice cream. In general, prices are very reasonable-- generally less expensive than Groceria Italiana.  Unlike Groceria Italiana, a good portion of the product consists of commercially-available brands--albeit many that you wouldn't encounter in a mainstream grocery store like Giant Eagle. Having said that, the main attraction for me is the made-in-house items, such as the fresh pasta, the sauces, and the biscotti, as well as the hot meals.\\n\\nIn the interest of brevity, here is a list of products I've bought at Donatelli's, followed by price, recommendation, and comments:\\n\\nGrandma's plain sauce ($3.65): Recommended--Better flavor and seasoning than commercial jarred sauces (e.g., Ragu, etc.)  Also, I like that Donatelli's makes meatless red sauce, unlike Groceria Italiana, since I don't eat beef.\\n\\nLobster ravioli ($9.99): Not recommended--After following boiling directions (necessary to avoid curdling cream sauce via baking), pasta was good, but filling was mushy.  Also, included imitation crabmeat, and I'm not a fan of imitation foods.  I'll be sticking to Groceria Italiana's handmade ravioli from now on.\\n\\nRicotta pie ($5.49): Recommended--Though this was my first time trying it, I was favorably impressed with the flavor and texture.\\n\\nBiscotti ($3.52): Recommended--I've only had the spumoni biscotti (a flavor I haven't seen elsewhere), but it tasted fresh and was good.\\n\\nItalian bread ($1.50): Recommended--Soft and fresh, and inexpensive\\n\\nHot food from deli counter: Recommended--I had the half pound fish sandwich ($2.49) and a half pound of the white cheddar bake ($2.99), and both were very good.  Notably, the roll was proportional to the fish, so the sandwich didn't fall apart, as is common at other PGH eateries serving fish sandwiches.\\n\\nDespite how hectic Donatelli's can be during peak hours, I've been impressed at the friendly service that I've received at the deli counter and checkout.  If there's one drawback, it's that waits at both counters are inevitable during these times.  Of course, if your schedule permits, this problem can be avoided by simply visiting at non-peak times.\\n\\nWhile Donatelli's may feel kind of cramped and may not seem as immaculately clean as some big box grocery stores (at least for the section the customer sees), this is part of its charm as a neighborhood ethnic grocery store.  I'll definitely continue stopping in for certain Italian grocery items, such as the plain sauce, biscotti, and bread, as well as for inexpensive, delicious hot lunch items.\"],\n",

Love that I can walk to it, that it has an amazing deli, some amazing frozen marinara sauces, and that the customer service is just great.\\n\\nI tend to come here for their fresh breads on Saturday, their grandma's marinara, and just the random things that I may forget at the regular grocery store. Oh not to mention they have 3 types of prosciutto!! Three!!  Anyway, they also have a ton of nuts, and sweets, as well and a boat load of olive oil. One thing that they are limited in is their produce, don't expect to get anything too crazy here.  Either way, this place is just clutch in order to have a good Italian dinner prepared at home.

She will be your greeter, your hostess, your waitresses, your personal cook, your bus person, and your cashier.  whew!!!!  Jeanie is not a jeannie in a bottle. She cannot snap her fingers so that your meal magically will appear in front of you.  She is the only person that I have ever seen working in there and you will definitely need time to wait and wait for your food.\\n\\n Her cooking area is quite small.  Trust me you do not want to question her about where your meal is or how much longer it will take for you to get it.   Jeanie does swear like a sailor, but in a quiet mild manner and NOT like a raging lunatic.  When you come here you will have to except every swear word constantly flowing from her mouth.    Trust me I  hate it with a passion when people swear, but with Jeanie, it is okay.\\n\\n But with Jeanie, you have to know it is coming and it will be coming in full force.  However while Jeanie will swear like a sailor she greets everybody with a kind and sweet heart.  She will make your order the way you want it.  Beware!!!!!  The portions are huge!!!!!   The coffee is endless. The prices are very reasonable. \\n\\n So why only four stars when it should really be a five.  Well as I mention Jeanie's swearing like a sailor is part of the 7 Cees experience.  I can deal with hearing damn, mf, shit,  etc.  I cannot stand hearing my best friends name being used in vain or as curse words.  When people say Jesus Christ name or God followed by the d word....

       "  u'D\\'Amico\\'s is like...Olive Garden, only less festive and with more \"local color.\"  We came here for a coworker holiday dinner at 530 pm on a Thursday.  We made a reservation for seven of us, but there was no need to call ahead - the place was empty except for a man sitting at the bar, and a couple of girls at another table across the room.  Definitely not hoppin\\'.  The color of the walls and the decor remind me of a hotel restaurant that only serves a breakfast buffet.  It\\'s very quiet in there, except for the low noises from a TV showing a football game in the next room.\\n\\nOur server was definitely \"set in her ways,\" as one of my coworkers said.  She had a routine in terms of when she took drink orders, when she took food orders, when she brought the check.  Deviations in the schedule seemed to cause a \"does not compute\" response across her face....like when I sat down and she asked what I wanted to drink.  I said I was going to wait until my next coworker arrived (thinking she might want to share some wine with me), and she was just like \"...you want to wait?  to order something to drink...?\" and I was all \"yes, I just got here....I don\\'t even know what I want!\" and she looked so confused, like how could some idiot like me possibly not know what they wanted to drink - finally she was like \"oh, do you need a list or something?\"  I know, I\\'m one of those difficult customers who requires a wine list in order to determine what wine I plan to order.  I\\'m weird like that.  Trying to order food at the same time as drinks was also a no-go.  You have to play by her rules.  When we did figure out the complicated drink-ordering situation, my coworker and I enjoyed our half-carafe of chardonnay.  I\\'d recommend getting a half carafe - the wine glasses are so small, paying $6 for a glass is a total rip off.  Get a half or full carafe and get your money\\'s worth.\\n\\nThe entrees come with soup and salad, which seems really old-school and kind of awesome to me.  They had one kind of soup, so you get what you get.  It was a chicken-vegetable-tortellini soup served in a little cup.  I liked it, because I like thin, brothy soups, but it wasn\\'t anything special.  The four little tortellinis floating around were the best part, and it was nice to have some veggies too.  Salad was standard iceberg lettuce, carrot shreds, some tinny-tasting black olives, and the acidic but not-bad strawberry vinaigrette that came on the side.  I didn\\'t bother with the bread - it didn\\'t look like anything special and it just came with butter packets.\\n\\nI got the pasta roll for my entree.  Despite having lots of ingredients (pasta, spinach, prosciutto, pine nuts, sambuca, tomato cream sauce, probably some cheese somewhere), the dish was surprisingly one note.  I didn\\'t think it was well-seasoned - I ended up pouring red pepper flakes on top to give it a zing, which didn\\'t help terribly.  The texture was good, and it was a cool idea, and it wasn\\'t a BAD dish, but it was just...meh.  Nothing exciting.  Very average.  Pretty bland.  I tasted a few other people\\'s dishes and my response was the same.  It\\'s just generic stuff.  Like I said, Olive Garden, only local.  Considering how \"meh\" the food was, I think it\\'s way overpriced.\\n\\nSo I wouldn\\'t go back.  It\\'s not my kind of food, or place.

I told them that I didn\\'t know which was my favourite, but I could tell you which was my least favourite: Tram\\'s. \\n\\nI don\\'t even care about the decor or seating etc. Usually the best Vietnamese comes from fairly sketchy looking joints. \\n\\nI had their \"Special\" noodle bowl which is their version of Bun thit nuong. It looked a mess. The spring rolls were cut up brutally and then everything was tossed in. Usually when you order this at other place, it doesn\\'t come \"pre-mixed.\" Honestly, it looked like someone had already starting eating this. I thought to myself... \"Okay they have a different presentation style.\" \\n\\nBut as I ate, I was even more disappointed. They hardly put any fresh vegetables in it, and the vermicelli is overcooked. The spring rolls were completely soggy. \\n\\nI don\\'t think their menu is limited though, it seemed fairly typical. I don\\'t know, maybe their Pho is better, but I\\'m already too disappointed to come back.\\n\\nAfter reading other people\\'s reviews and trying other Vietnamese places around the city and then having Vietnamese food in Toronto(at an average place), I\\'m throughly convinced that people in this city have no idea what Vietnamese food is supposed to taste like.\\n\\nOh and one last thing... do you actually believe that their food is vegetarian? I guess the joke\\'s on you.'],\n",

       "  u'Like a couple others, I\\'m really not sure what all the fuss is about this place.  I moved to Pittsburgh from Seattle where you can find some of the absolute best Vietnamese food.  This place is a hole-in-the-wall with a very brusque owner/waiter and kind of dingy decor.  I don\\'t mind any of these things actually, but the food I definitely took some issue with.  I ordered a tofu-veggie dish (can\\'t remember the name) served over rice.  My boyfriend ordered the pork rice vermicelli bowl.  Our food came fast enough and it was served hot.  However, my dish was nothing to brag about.  It was pretty average tasting Asian fare.  It didn\\'t taste bad by any means, but not restaurant quality.  Good thing it was only about 6 bucks.  My boyfriend\\'s dinner was a real disappointment, however.  My favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Seattle had HUGE vermicelli bowls with absolutely fresh lettuce and onions, piled high on top of perfectly cooked noodles.  The meat/tofu you ordered with it was never sparse and it was cooked to perfection.  Everything was doused with some sweet fish sauce and presented with some sliced egg roll.  The pork vermicelli that came to my table did not resemble this at all.  It was served in a rather small bowl with just a few pieces of lettuce and onion.  The \"pork\" that was on top amounted to about 1/4 of a cup of weird texturized, shredded something.  It almost looked like boiled ground beef.  I felt sorry for my boyfriend because he had never eaten Vietnamese food before and I had recommended a vermicelli dish to him because they are (usually) delicious.  As a double whammy, his dish was about 9 dollars!  Neither of us were full when we were done with our meals, so we ordered some spring rolls, which were supposed to be what they are famous for.  I don\\'t understand this either.  The rolls were extremely bland and chewy.  The sauce that was served with it didn\\'t do much to save it.  Overall, I wouldn\\'t recommend this place and I will continue my search for good Vietnamese food elsewhere.  Also, please take note they only accept cash and no cards.'],\n",

       "  u'I see a lot of confusion in the other reviews; people seem to either love or hate Tram\\'s.  I think I can help explain this issue.\\n\\nTram\\'s has a fairly full menu, but there are two things on the menu that you should be ordering:  the soups (particularly, the beef pho) and the fresh spring rolls.  That\\'s it.\\n\\nIf you\\'ve had Pho in other cities, you might not understand Tram\\'s.  There\\'s no Vietnamese community in Pittsburgh, so you can\\'t get all the trimmings you might have come to expect:   no tripe, no tendon, no other strange meat parts. Just beef or chicken.  But what sets Tram\\'s apart, in my view, is the quality of his broth.  I have eaten Pho all around the US, and Tram\\'s broth is, in my view, the very best I\\'ve had.\\n\\nSo get the pho (or, if you\\'re in the mood for something different, the Saigon Soup), get the spring rolls, and skip everything else on the menu.  Then you\\'ll understand Tram\\'s.\\n\\nIncidentally, the owner\\'s name is not \"Tram\".  His name is Le Thao.  Tram is his daughter, who was left behind in Vietnam for many years, when his son needed a kidney transplant in the US.'],\n",

I was expecting more fresh herbs on the pho, but the complex broth more than made up for any lackings. \\n\\nI will definitely be heading back to this cheap, tasty hole-in-the wall.\"],\n",

For that PhoFix in da Burgh, you gotta go to Tram's. \\n\\nSometimes I think the Yelp Rating needs to be aware of the circumstances. It's not dumbing down, it's just knowing your surroundings.

       "  u\"Cheap, tasty, filling.  We tried the pho, spring rolls, and lemongrass chicken; all were well worth ordering again.  This was, however, my first Vietnamese meal, so my thoughts are necessarily less discerning.  \\n\\nThe owner is indeed a character, and he more or less ordered for one of us.  Luckily, we're pretty easy going, and generally happy to take a proprietor's advice on what's good.  He struck me as amusing and endearing rather than abrasive.\\n\\nThe place was packed, though we went at 7 on a Friday.  Given this and the fact that they take no reservations, it'd probably be a hassle to go there with parties larger than 4.\"],\n",

       "  u'Meh. I was visiting from NYC when I ate here before a show at the Brillobox. The beef pho was sub par. Food took about 10 minutes to arrive when it did the beef was already cooked through (that\\'s a BIG no-no in my book). I could hardly make out the star anise in the broth, and the bean sprouts had seen better days. The framed PPG review says Tram\\'s has the best Pho in Pittsuburgh; if that\\'s actually true, then the state of  Pho in Pittsburgh is in bad shape.\\n\\nI also tried the vegetarian satay that my wife ordered and it was pretty decent, so plus one star for having vegetarian soups, and more importantly, actually trying to make it good. It beat the pants off of the veggie Viet place on 6th st. in NYC. I kinda have my doubts about their interpretation of \"vegetarian\" though I kept that to myself...\\n\\nAs others have noted, the decor is kinda dumpy and the guy that took my order was surly, but I wonder if there\\'s some kind of inverse halo effect going on here. Some hole-in-the-walls are just that: a hole in the wall.\\n\\nAlso: $8 for Pho does not make for hole-in-the-wall pricing.'],\n",

We came here with friends for dinner after Day 1 of selling at Handmade Arcade. We got there just in time since it got packed shortly after we sat down. There was a slight language barrier, so instead of getting the chicken with crispy noodles, I got tofu, but you know what? I didn't even notice until 5 minutes after eating and then I looked across the table at my friend Jessica's dish that clearly had chicken and we had ordered the same thing. Oh well. I don't regret it at all. It was delicious and I ate every bite. Also the vegetable gyoza we started with was very tasty.

Pho is a good meal to warm you up in the winter and this place is a great place to stop in for a yummy dinner.  I have been a little wary to go off the beaten path of the spring rolls and the Pho, so I got the spring rolls and the chicken peanut soup (I think that is what it was called).  It was very close to the chicken Pho, except it had less noodles, more veggies, and a little different twist on the sauce with some crunched peanuts that settled at the bottom and a bit more spice.  The dishes definitely didn't disappoint.  The parking is on the street (which is usually pretty empty after working hours), and the ambiance seems to have perked up a little bit with what I think is a new coat of baby blue paint and some new flowery table cloths.  Don't worry though, the mother of pearl wall art is still there, and your chances of not understanding your server is still high.

I was expecting to see many different types of PHO on the menu, but there was only one line with PHO on it.  This made it easier for me to make my decision even though the vermicelli bowls were tempting.  I also ordered two spring rolls.   The spring rolls came out and they were much bigger than i was expecting.  They tasted fresh, crunchy and filled with goodness such as shrimp, pork, noodles, and herbs.  I dipped them in a chili sauce as well as a brown sauce to complete this delicious experience.  The only negative of my meal was I ordered chicken and shrimp pho and ended up getting Beef pho.  I am guessing i confused the server/owner while i was ordering.   I didn't bother to complain since i figured he wouldn't understand anyways, so i began to consume my pho.  Every aspect of the dish was perfect from the noodles, to the beef to the sprouts that I got to dunk in every so often.  My meal ended up costing $14 without tip and was worth every penny.

       "  u'Was craving Pho while in Pittsburgh - and so on to Yelp I went and found the reviews for this place. So off I went in search of Tram\\'s.\\n\\nTram\\'s is located in a section of Pittsburgh that is a little on the run down side - the area has seen better days. But that did not phase me - adds some character to the place!\\n\\nIt was about 1:45 pm when I rolled in. Was given a choice of where to sit  - a little old man with one arm (or perhaps he was missing just the hand? - could not tell) took my order. He did not seem to friendly - I asked him a couple of questions and it was hard to get anything out of him.\\n\\nI ordered Pho Ga with white meat (although their menu lists it as \"Pho Hanoi\") with garden rolls and a glass of water.\\n\\nI suspected that perhaps their approach to Pho was going to be more Northern Vietnam based on the name for the soup - and I was partially correct. When the soup came out - the noodles were the slightly wider ones rather than the very thin ones.\\n\\nNow I\\'m guessing that many of my Yelp friends from the DC area that like Pho would not have liked the Pho here.  Unless I\\'m mistaken - most of you folks seem to prefer to have all of the fat skimmed and strained out of your Pho broth - which I am against. It makes the broth to clear and light and there is a significant reduction in flavor and richness when this is done. And they certainly weren\\'t doing that here. In fact - there was a slight oiliness or greasiness to the broth - but not overly so. It gave the broth a delicious richness and subtly in flavor that was just so damn good!\\n\\nI added all of the aromatics and veggies. I will say that the amount of Basil, and the quality of the Basil were the low points of the meal. The poor Basil had seen better days.\\n\\nI then tasted the broth and was floored by how good it was. I detected light, rich hints of star anise and cinnamon, which when combined with chicken essence fat globules and onions - was just outstanding. Rich, savory, wonderful!\\n\\nI added Sriracha sauce to individual bites of food as I went - and only added a little to the broth at the very end. I really wanted to savor the broth the way it was.\\n\\nCons:\\n- The rolls were not very fresh - in fact I did not finish them because they weren\\'t very good.\\n- The Basil was not crisp and fresh\\n- The restrooms need to be gutted and retrofitted\\n\\nSo I\\'m only docking them one star for the cons - the Pho was outstanding IMHO - so four stars overall!\\n\\nCash only - no credit cards. I had a bit of a hard time finding parking - so beware of that.'],\n",

Until I stirred it around to find out it was mainly broth and green onions.  The broth was flavorless, actually it didn't have any flavor; so I had to add hoisin sause to give it a little of whatever to go along with the sliced pork.  I was confused about the noodle itself, Pho is usually served with flat vermicelli noodle; but this Pho Ha Noi was served with round vermicelli noodles usually for Bun Bo entree.  I asked the old man with the amputated arm, why it was served with bun (round rice noodle) instead of pho (flat rice noodle) noodles, he laughed and insisted it was pho (flat rice noodle).

But there's no reason to order anything but the Pho.  There are many options, but keep it simple.  Pho real.  It's unbelievably tasty and filling.  One bowl will have you stuffed, but if you have a massive appetite, the spring rolls are also huge and delicious.  \\n\\nPrice: One person can gorge themselves with tip included for under $10.

Hey it's Tram's Kitchen, and we're just eating there.  Wear a blindfold, you'll still taste the remarkable food.  Cash only.\\n\\nService: A waiter will be to your table with water before you even hit the seat, and another will be over for your order within 60 seconds.  Thats why you just order the pho.  There's no wasting time at Tram's.  Sit down, order, food comes quick, bill shortly after, eat, go home.\\n\\n(+): Tram's is a can't miss restaurant in Pittsburgh.

It's kind of a hole-in-the-wall kind of place, but the food is what I expected walking in.  Spring rolls are not flavorful and has too much minced meat and not enough of veggies for a good balance.  Also, I suspect they are the frozen variety and are not made in house.  Summer rolls are meh....  They're big, but again nothing special.  I've had the pho here and once again Pittsburgh disappoints me in the quality of pho that it has.  At Tram's, the pho bowl is small.  I don't expect a huge basin-size bowl, but a bowl of pho needs to have enough noodle, broth, herbs and spiced.  The meat is too overcooked for pho tai (pho with thinly sliced beef steak that is supposed to be cooked only when the boiling hot broth is poured in the bowl).  The taste is reminiscent of pho but isn't quite right.  You need to want to take your bowl and drink all the broth at the end of the meal and you should feel satisfied and be in a comatose state after a good bowl of pho.  This wasn't it.  \\n\\nThat said, the service is nice.  However, I didn't feel too comfortable/relaxed eating here.  It was dark and crowded (and a little bit dingy).

Not sure how the people who have given it negative reviews could arrive at their conclusions, but hey, everyone's entitled to his/her opinion, right?\\n\\nEverything I have ever ordered here has come fast and fresh. Spring Rolls are a must, and can be made a meal unto themselves. Chicken fried rice is astounding. Vermicelli dishes are a great treat in the warmer months (because they come at a cool temperature, and are almost salad-like), and the chicken pho is transcendent.\\n\\nYes, transcendent.\\n\\nI yearn for the cold months because it means that I can eat the stuff - my wife at first was horrified that I referred to chicken pho as the best broth based food I had ever eaten. Hell, she even made fun of me for craving 'chicken soup,' which most people would simply make at home, but this is not like anything at home, this is the ultimate comfort dish. The beef pho is good, but their chicken version is simply the best.\\n\\nI know that they had some problems with their accreditation, but that appears to be well in their past, and frankly, I never had a single problem with their food before that.

He can be moody at times, but I have never found him to be rude even on a bad or busy day (he probably just doesn't have time for slowpokes who can't make up their mind). I would cut him some slack if he doesn't appear to be the most patient person in the world. \\n\\nParking in Lawrenceville can be iffy at times, but if you drive west a few blocks past Tram's there are usually many streetside spots.

Maybe because I'm vietnamese and being a visitor to Pittsburg for the first time, they think is ok to overprice their dishes on a Sunday night. \\n\\nAlthough the old man at the place is nice, this place doesn't deserve the stars that's given. I don't recommend this place to anyone especially my Vietnamese comrades whom may visit to Pittsburg looking for good authentic home town cooking.\"],\n",

       "  u'If you grew up in a part of the country with lots of Vietnamese food or have eaten it in such places, you\\'re not going to be impressed by Tram\\'s.\\n\\nI gave this place two tries and was disappointed both times. I will admit that I only tried the pho and a vermicelli bowl (on separate trips), but having ordered anything else on each of my trips would have put my bill in the neighborhood of $12+. Having grown up with cheap Vietnamese food in Texas, I wasn\\'t prepared to spend that much for what\\'s supposed to be a budget lunch, even with the understanding that I was going to leave hungry and that the lack of non-European ethnic diversity in Pittsburgh is going to automatically make things more expensive.\\n\\nEither way, I don\\'t understand the hype surrounding this place. The pho bowl was small, with a tasteless broth and child-sized portions of noodles and meat. After a few bites, I drenched the whole thing in Sriracha just to give it some flavor and to try to trick my stomach into feeling a bit more like I had eaten something.\\n\\nThe vermicelli was not so great either--a small portion of vegetables and noodles with a few too-thick chunks of pork that were not grilled long enough for any sort of darkness or crisp (but which still managed to be dry). The color of the dish was as bland as the taste.\\n\\nAs for the atmosphere, not a big deal for me. The restaurant is small, with minimal seating and some dinginess to it, but that\\'s fairly common for older Vietnamese restaurants. Most diners are young, hip, and not Asian (which could be a turn-off for some due to the perceived lack of authenticity and/or hipsteriness). Parking is a chore; if you live nearby and choose to give the place a try, walk or ride your bike, or prepare to find yourself circling nearby blocks of permit-only parking.\\n\\nFolks who dine at Tram\\'s should keep in mind that cheaper, better, more authentic Vietnamese food exists out there. I grew up in North Texas (Dallas-Fort Worth area), where with one of the largest Vietnamese populations in the country, good, cheap Vietnamese food can be found all over the metro area. Pho portions down there are reasonably big, there are plenty of different meat combinations, and you can almost always choose the size of the bowl you want (usually kid\\'s, small, large, and extra-large). Additionally, due to the presence of plenty of fresh ingredient suppliers and competition, prices are more in line with portion size, and the food is, more often than not, good. Most folks with normal appetites are able to leave satisfied having spent no more than $7 or $8 a person with tax and tip (compared to $20 at Tram\\'s). Out of all the Vietnamese spots in North Texas that I\\'ve tried, my absolute favorite is Pho Pasteur, in Arlington: The pho, vermicelli bowls, crushed rice dishes, spring and egg rolls, and prices are all excellent. Tram\\'s would be put out of business if anyone ever opened a restaurant like that up here.\\n\\nIf none of the other few choices in Pittsburgh are satisfying your Vietnamese food cravings, it might be worth it to take a weekend trip up to Toronto. You would also have access there to some other Asian foods that we don\\'t have here, such as dim sum and Taiwanese \"small eats.\" For a slightly shorter drive, you can also find these things (though more sparsely) in the D.C. suburbs.'],\n",

I enjoyed the fried egg roll way more, but I wouldn't discourage someone from trying Tram's fresh spring roll.\\n\\nFor dinner, I had the Vermicelli noodles with coconut milk and beef. It was sweet and savory, but it missed a kick of spiciness to counter the coconut milk. I asked the staff for crushed red chili pepper flakes, but there was a significant language barrier which impeded me from conveying my request. Eventually, I said pepper enough, and I was brought jalape\\xf1o peppers.

Whenever we walked into the restaurant we saw that not much has changed except for maybe the addition of a flat screen TV.  The restaurant itself is small and maybe has seating at tables for about 30 people and the decorations are a little sparse.  The easiest thing to see is that they have won a ton of awards which are hanging up on the back wall.  Beyond that it is still a hole in the wall divey type of place that is cash-only with excellent food.  \\n \\nAlmost immediately after we sat down the owner asked us if we were ready to order.  At that point we were not ready.  The menu here isn't that big but it doesn't need to be since what they do make is very good.  About two minutes later the owner was back and ready to take our order.  This time we were ready.  My fiance and I decided to split some eggrolls and then for my entree I went with the beef vermicelli with conconut milk.\\nThe eggrolls came out at the same time as the meals and were so hot temperature wise that both my fiance and myself left them until after we had eaten our entrees.  My vermicelli ended up being really good with the sauce providing the perfect flavor to the dish.  I don't know how they do it but they do a great job of infusing a ton of flavors into it.  The noodles in it were also good and the beef was better than expected.  After I had finished my vermicelli I ended up grabbing my eggrolll which was still somehow hot.  While the flavor on it wasn't that great, what I really loved about it was the textures that it provided.  It was cooked perfectly and so the shell had a great crispy exterior while the interior with the vegetables had a softer texture.  Overall it was another solid meal at Tram's for me.\\n \\nThe bottom line for me is that I will definitely be back here again in the future.   Whats not to like about a place where the food is not only cheap but also delicious?  Just be careful in that it is cash only and I know at one point they were BYOB although I am not sure if that is still the case.\"],\n",

The only complaints I could pose were that it was very mild, and it a bit spicier.\\n\\nOverall, above average, but my quest for the perfect Pho continues.'],\n",

In fact, I like how light the broth is and how it isn't heavy. I had the Shrimp Pho, which was delicious; the shrimps were also tender and not overcooked.

However, I noticed that these garnishes were a bit limp and dry, not fresh.\\n\\nThe spring rolls were a nice start, but I would say that it's a bit dry.

Not too floury, but also not too thin (to the point of falling apart). The pho also came along with a dish of bean sprouts and basil. I mostly used the bean sprouts, which came fresh.\\nIn general, I found it to be relatively satisfying.

       "  u'Tram\\'s is one of the best options for quick and healthy vegetarian/vegan food in the Lawrenceville area.

I crave this stuff.  It tastes so good that it\\'s shocking how healthful it actually must be.  Other favorites are the spring rolls, the vermicelli with tofu and vegetables (hot dish with a different sauce and vegetables), and the pho soup.  The complaints in other reviews are spot-on: it is cash only and BYOB, a bit cranky and rushed service-wise at times, and not the most restful decor and interior (noise from tv and staff\\'s children and dated plastic tablecloths/decor).

It really is HER KITCHEN, not a restaurant... There is only one table that seats 8-10 people.  But her cooking is amazing.  Lots of home-style italian favorites come out in a fabulous 6 course meal.  I could have eaten just the antipasti alone as a full meal; the standout was a baked pumpkin full of gruyere, herbs and croutons... delicious.  For dinner, we had butternut squash soup with gorganzola and pecans, homemade pasta with a pistachio cream sauce, veal chops and an italian vegetable medely that was perfect with everything else.  Tiramisu for desert.  Everything that came out was delicious and perfectly prepared - plus Maria was standing right there in the kitchen to answer any questions we had about the food or cooking in general.  Wine was BYOB, and I think we went through ~10 bottles.  No corkage fees...\\n\\nThis is an amazing dinner for those who have patience.

       "  u\"I can't say enough about Merante's and Maria. The back of the shop has wonderful baked goods. Pies, breads and of course the best biscotti around! Though, the true treasure exists in the upstairs apartment where Maria has cooking classes and serves a 6 course meal to parties of  8-10 most nights of the week. I heard about the private parties while at a food tour of Bloomfield. I knew I needed to get a reservation but, I had no idea how difficult that task would be. We scheduled a dinner in October for the first available Friday or Saturday which was 6 months later! That's right folks, 6 months in advance! \\n\\nThe menu changes seasonally and is posted on the website. We ordered earlier in the week so that Maria had time to purchase the necessary items and prepare our meal. The menu would typically be the same for all 8 in the party but, Maria graciously offered to allow us to split the entrees into a meat and a non meat option to allow those who don't eat meat on Fridays during lent to have another option. When we arrived, we all enjoyed the appetizers in a sitting room at the front of the apartment. The appetizers themselves were a meal- meatballs, bread, shrimp, spinach pie, stuffed tomatoes and cheese with roasted peppers- all of which were incredible. Bring along your wine as Merante's is BYOB. \\nThe next course was soup which we were served in the formal dinning room which opened to the small kitchen where Maria cooks your meal. At first it was a little awkward sitting so close to the kitchen and Maria. Imagine having dinner at your grandmother's home with 7  of your closest friends. But, Maria did a great job of giving us our privacy. We hardly even noticed that she was there. After the soup came the pasta (homemade gnocchi anyone?), then the entrees and vegetables, then the salad and last, the dessert. This was a meal fit for a king! The portions were huge! Luckily, Maria boxed up the leftovers making for an easy lunch the next day. If your lucky, you may even get to take home a little extra something such as extra sauce or a homemade truffle. Absolutely everything about this dinner was perfection. Everything (from the food to the service and hospitality) was done with the utmost care and concern to ensure a wonderful experience. I would literally come here every month if it were possible. Unfortunately, Maria is booked through the end of 2014! Not one day available in the next 8 months! My only complaint, Maria is in serious need of a clone.\"],\n",

       "  u\"This review is specifically for the dinner that I enjoyed in the apartment above Merante's Gift Shop.\\n\\nI have stopped by here twice now for dinner, both times with a group of 8 people.  The first time that we ate here my wife and I were both unsure of where to go.  We hesistantly headed up the stairs next to the shop into the apartment above which thankfully ended up being the correct place!  The apartment consists of a couple of rooms off to the right where you can mingle and eat your appetizers and then the kitchen a bit farther down where we have always had the rest of our meal.\\n\\nOn both of our visits we have started off the evening with 6 different appetizers.  This last time around we had meatballs, a tuscan loaf of bread covered in spices, a cucumber salad, stuffed mushrooms, roasted vegetables and a stuffed tomato.  My favorite of the bunch both times was the tuscan loaf covered in spices.  After you finish up the appetizers you are invited into the kitchen where the rest of the meal is served family style.  First up at the table was our soup which was a minostrone genovese.  Maria, the main cook, suggested that we add some red pepper flakes and some parmesan to it which gave it some extra flavor and the little bit of kick which I loved.  Whenever we were finished with our soups, ricotta gnocchi was served to our table with a red sauce made with pork and beef simmered in red wine and tomatoes.  What is nice about this place is that Maria is very accomodating to food allergies.  Since I am not able to have red wine, they made a special bowl of the gnocchi for me with a san marzano sauce.  It was really good and I loved how light and fluffy the gnocchi ended up being.  Once that course was finished we were presented with a crown roast of pork on one platter and winter vegetables on another.  The crown roast of pork was quite impressive and the 8 of us had a hard time finishing even half of.  The vegetables were also good here and I was sad that I had filled up as much as I did as I was not able to eat as many as I would have liked.  There was also some green beans with tomatoes and olives floating around which is pretty much the only item of the night that I didn't really care for.  While I normally love green beans, they tasted of the olives that they were cooked with and so it wasn't for me.  Of course with all of the other food on the table I didn't even really care and I know its something that I normally would not have ordered at a restaurant.  The salad was served next after the main course.  It consisted of apples, pecans and cranberries over Romaine and was topped with their balsamic glaze dressing.  It was really good and I especially loved the large granules of sea salt (Maldon perhaps?) that were on it which helped to make it taste extra good.  Last but not least was our dessert which was Chocolate LOOOOOOVE Cake.  It consisted of chocolate custard, chocolate cake and chocolate Mousse.  Since chocalate is the other food besides red wine which I am not able to enjoy, Maria was nice enough to make me a cinnamon cannoli for dessert.  While everyone was enjoying their chocolate cake, my dessert was brought to the table and was greeted with an audible sigh from some other members of our party that they were not getting the cannoli also.  As we were finishing our desserts Maria produced a decaf espresso for anyone that wanted it.  It had a nice orange flavor to it and was very good.  When all was said and done, all of the substantial amount of food that our group did not eat was packed up by Maria and set aside for us to take home.  Everyone ended up leaving with a fair amount of it.\\n\\nThe bottom line for me is that we will be back here again in the future.  As a matter of a fact we already have our reservation made with the same group for July.  Beyond that my wife and I are trying to get some family together for another time.  If you are looking at trying to eat here I recommend that you book early because as of early Februrary all of the weekend days through November were already booked.  The only other thing to note about this place is that it is BYOB.\"],\n",

Soon I realized that maybe the back of the store was off limites? There is a cookie counter with window back there, so it looks like it is just part of the store, but by her unfriendly insistance about what I wanted, I got the sense that I was not to be there. I asked to buy one of the peanut butter cookies that that had been making... thinking that I could eat it while browsing in the store... and she quickly responded,  \"We only sell them by the half or full dozen.\" By this time, I didn\\'t feel very welcome or even that she was interested in selling me anything.

The bread for the french toast was plain white toast and I normally prefer a better bread. The eggs were eggs: good without any pizzazz.\\n\\nWhile Ritters is cheap, from my small sampling, I found the food boring.

Not sure if its like this all the time, but it's a seat yourself type of establishment.  When we were there the place wasn't too busy and easy to run for the one server manning the floor.

From grape leaves to meatloaf. Speaking of meatloaf, that's what I had. Two decent size slices of meatloaf, a scoop of diner mashed potatoes, and the gravy on the side. I also opted for the side salad, which was simple with iceberg lettuce, onion, tomato and green pepper.

I didn't even know diners served this vast variety of food.  I am a huge fan of breakfast food, because besides it being the most important meal of the day, I love the doughy goodness and comfort of pancakes and waffles. This time I was dissuaded from ordering my usual and instead opted for some proper dinner food. \\n\\nThe spanakopita was a bit soggy but otherwise the meal was above satisfactory. I had my first experience of fried zucchini and now I know what the fuss is all about! They're a delicious alternative to the classic potato fries and I delight to try them again.  While many people are unfavorably disposed to fish,  I love it. I think it's an acquired taste, but their fish was perfectly crispy and the tartar sauce wasn't half bad either!

       "  u\"Great food, quick service, nostalgia: what more could you ask for? \\n\\nMy dad brought me to Ritter's many times when I was a kid, before we moved out of the city. Now that I'm commuting to Pitt, I'm back. Before even talking about the food, I'd like to say how nice the staff is. They're always in a good mood, and they know their stuff. In the three years that I've been going there I don't think that they've ever let my coffee cup go empty. \\n\\nBreakfast is excellent, no matter what time of day you have it. I especially love their homefries, which are nice and crispy but not overdone. This may seem like a minor thing, but you'd be surprised how many restaurants can mess up a fried potato. If you're coming in for lunch I would strongly suggest one of their salads; the lettuce is fresh and crisp and so are the toppings. If you get a steak salad, the steak comes right off of the grill and onto your plate, along with the fries. The soups are also delicious, although the Greek Lemon Soup is a bit sweet. I love their Navy Bean and Beef Barley soups, can't get enough of them. For lunch or dinner they have good comfort food: meatloaf with mushroom gravy, pork chops and kraut, stuffed cabbage, etc. Some days they make a homemade Greek pastitsio (did I spell that right?), which I think is even better than what is served at the Greek Food Festival in Oakland. \\n\\nOne last thing that I'd like to say is that they know how to make eggs over-easy. I like my fried eggs very runny or dippy or however you say it, and Ritter's makes them just so. A lot of breakfast places that I've been to tend to give you over-medium when you ask for over-easy. Just another indication that the cooks know their stuff.\"],\n",

It's not anything to marvel at, but it's diner food, and you're getting exactly what you think. \\n\\nTheir menu is typical diner food, but more expansive than most - I was a little surprised to see seafood options. Ultimately, I always come back to the corned beef hash. Exactly like canned corned beef hash in every other diner, but that's exactly what I'm looking for. I also occasionally order the wings because Ritter's makes them the way I prefer - freshly fried, naked, with your choice of dipping sauce on the side. I've occasionally tried to branch out but find other dishes lacking. The meatloaf was dry, lacking in flavor, but still a very heavy dish; the burger was even dryer and was served deconstructed - in a bad way. However, friends have had the differing variants of the pancakes and enjoyed them. \\n\\nOverall, the cheap prices (yet cash only!), 24 hour convenience, and rectifying my late night munchies get Ritter's a thumbs-up in my book.\"],\n",

       "  u\"I remember my first experience at a diner: Art Deco-inspired architecture, narrow and long floorplan, jukeboxes, neon signs, quick service, and extremely tasty pancakes with chocolate syrup! Granted I was only 7 or 8 years old then, but I can recall everything (how can I forget the taste of those pancakes?!). Since then, I've been to quite a few diners, including diner-restaurants (i.e. faux diners). I would go particularly on the morning after a night of partying and/or drinking, when I'm feeling too lazy or hung over to cook something decent without burning myself and my kitchen. On these mornings, I would typically order pancakes or omelettes with a side (usually hash browns) and coffee. Honestly, I've never eaten anything other than these breakfast staples at a diner.\\n\\nMy friends and I arranged to have a late brunch one day at Ritters Diner. Now, I didn't have much to eat the night before, so I couldn't wait until we met to have something to eat. So, I came to the diner having already eaten a light breakfast. A quick observation of the diner made me realize that this isn't a traditional diner; instead, it seemed more like a diner-restaurant. Oh well, there was still the service and the food to worry about. We sat down at a booth in the large room in the back of the restaurant. The waitress greeted us and took our drink orders immediately: two cups of coffee and two glasses of water. Several minutes later, we got our coffee and water, but weren't ready to order just yet. We spent several more minutes deciding, and when we were ready, we placed our menus in a neat stack in the center of the table to show that we were ready to order. We waited...and waited...and waited some more. Minutes turned into half an hour and longer. By that point, my friends were getting quite hangry. I was sitting there feeling sorry for them and very concerned with the poor service. This whole time, I was monitoring discreetly the other diners who had our waitress and arrived after we did. A few of them actually have gotten their food, have paid, and have left. After what seemed like an eternity, our waitress suddenly materializes and takes our order.\\n\\nWe get our food: chocolate chip pancakes; club sandwich; spinach omelette with cheese and buttered toast; and something else (sorry, I must've had too much coffee). My omelette was decent; I would have preferred if they hadn't used too much cheese, especially what I think was American cheese (it could've been cheddar, but the taste didn't seem right). The toast was good, but I was too full to keep eating. I did try a bite of the chocolate chip pancakes, and it was so rich and delicious! My other two starving friends pretty much inhaled their food in minutes.\\n\\nBased on this one experience, I would come only for the pancakes. Service was really bad even though the place was half empty. I might experiment with this diner once or twice more to get a better feel for it.\\n\\nSo to summarize: not a real diner, service was bad, food was decent, and come for the pancakes.\"],\n",

       "  u'It is definitely an experience. Located in not such a great part of town. Very old. Food is just ok, grease upon grease. Everything came out from the kitchen hot, but looked like it was all cooked in the same grease in the same pan. Waitresses do not make much of an effort. She was more concerned with eating her meal.  Cashier was a breath of fresh air. She was chatty and nice.'],\n",

       "  u'Awful experience. We went on a Sunday afternoon. While waiting in the line, an employee and the owner asked us (in the rudest and most condescending manner possible) to shut the front door because it was cold--despite the fact that we were not the ones holding it open. When our waitress took our order, I asked her if the hot turkey sandwich or the turkey, bacon, and Swiss sandwich was better. She looked at me as if I had just asked her if they sold toilet brushes there before shrugging and telling me that \"they are both pretty popular.\" We ordered wings and pierogies for appetizers, for which we waited 45 minutes. When my boyfriend asked our waitress if the food would be coming soon, she again acted extremely annoyed, as if our presence was a nuisance. She told us she did not know when the food would be up because \"Sundays are really busy.\" When the pierogies came we were disappointed to realize that only three came in an order. The wings were dry. I had decided on the hot turkey sandwich, which was a little dry but tasted okay overall. The bill was $40, which seemed exorbitant, especially in light of the horrible service and poor attitudes of every employee that we encountered.'],\n",

Yeah, that place is that old and that outdated.\\n\\nMy Order : Eggs/Sausage/Potatoes/Toast, Fried Chicken and French Fries and finally, Chili Cheese Fries.\\n\\nThe good:\\n- They have parking, though their lot is a bit odd. No parking = no visit from me.\\n- The eggs were pretty good. Can't say anything bad about them and they were some of the better eggs I had. \\n- The potatoes/home fries were also pretty good. \\n- I really like the consistency of their french fries. Their fries are long and taste good.\\n- The breakfast prices are reasonable.\\n- They do have a wide variety of options on their menu. They have seafood, burgers, hot dogs, chicken, steak, breakfast food, ice cream and other stuff.\\n\\nThe bad:\\n- It's 2015 and they have no website or menu. Think about that. I have no idea how they could ever find customers not from the local area. They could put up a website for free and a menu as well. It would take less than 1 day of their time. There's restaurants from third world countries that have menu's online.\\n- They want $1.75 for cheese on their eggs. I can almost buy a full pack of cheese for that price\\n- The fried chicken is so so, but they want $7.70ish for one chicken wing sized leg, a mostly small breast and an even smaller leg. Not worth it at all, since you can get a better deal at Popeye's or KFC, who I both find expensive. Their chicken is better too.\\n\\nMy friend got an omelet of some sort and seemed to really like it.\\n\\nWould I return there? I could see myself returning for a quick breakfast once in a while, but I don't see myself going there for dinner.\\n\\nRecommendation: I can't say I recommend you going out of your way for this place. There's really nothing special about it, but they do have a wide variety of options on their menu, parking and the breakfast prices are reasonable. It's no Peppermill(a chain of diner restaurants in the west that are fabulous) though.\"],\n",

       "  u'I\\'d like to preface this by saying I am not one to go out of my way to write a negative review and am really easy to please. Nevertheless...\\n\\nA few of us went out after late night bowling to get some food. We went to Ritters because it was literally the only place open within a 5 mile radius and we were starving. Anyways, we made our way past the pack of chain smoking waitresses on the front steps and were seated. Every surface in this place is covered in a thin layer of oily grime. It\\'s clear that cleanliness is not a priority here. Your hand will stick to the table if you touch it. And the bathroom looks and smells like something out of the movie Saw.\\n\\nThe waitstaff didn\\'t even pretend to be friendly and honestly looked like they just rolled in from a halfway house. Also, our frail, elderly waitress was clearly extremely ill and really shouldn\\'t have been handling food. The food itself was pretty terrible, but it\\'s a diner and the only option around after midnight, so whatever.\\n\\nWe got the bill and proceeded to the counter to pay. The little old white-haired curmudgeon who I guess runs the place shuffles over to the counter, rips the bill out of my hand and says \"Give me $28.38\". I politely ask if we could pay separately (there were four of us). He grunts something inaudible with a sourpuss look on his face and I ask him to repeat himself. He then raises his voice and rudely says \"Give me $28.38. I don\\'t have time for this, I\\'m very busy\". It was 1:00 am, there were maybe 10 people in the entire place, and all he was doing was sipping coffee at the counter. He could have just said \"Sorry, we don\\'t split checks\" and it would have been fine. No need to be nasty. He\\'s like the Soup Nazi from Seinfeld but not nearly as funny. You shouldn\\'t be mean and condescending to your customers if you want them to return. I know that neither I nor my friends ever will.'],\n",

Yep...leftover food particles. I have a healthy immune system I think....well then my sprite came in a clear glass. The white milk like stain on the inside of the drink was slowly flaking off into my ice....last straw...I told the waitress and walked out. FILTHY MCNASTY!  My morning review is below:\\n\\n\\nWalked over from UPMC to have breakfast. Typical diner look and menu. I really don't get the hype as the food was average at best.

       "  u'I was visiting a church in the area and decided to try this diner. It had mixed reviews so my curiosity got the best of me. \\nThe menu is lengthy. I am a huge breakfast food fan so I decided to order breakfast. I usually go the eggs and bacon route, but flipped the script when I saw the Coco Loco pancakes. They are pancakes with chocolate chips and coconut. I also ordered a side of bacon. My son got bacon & eggs that came with toast and home fries. \\nWhen my pancakes came they looked like your typical pancakes with a light sprinkling of coconut and chocolate chips. There was also a drizzle of chocolate syrup. I was a tad disappointed. I ate the top pancake and it was incredibly delicious. I thought \" it\\'s too bad this is not in each pancake. Still hungry I started eating the two remaining pancakes. Oh. My. Word. There wasn\\'t any coconut in them but they were packed with chocolate chips. I\\'m talking packed!  They were some of the best pancakes I\\'ve ever had. The side of bacon was a little salty which was needed to break up all of the sweetness of the pancakes. My son eats \"dippy\" eggs ( runny sunny side up). I\\'m not a fan but he enjoyed them. Living in the Burgh we are used to getting Italian bread as toast but this was true blue white sandwich bread. He cleaned his plate so that should tell you that he liked it a lot. \\nThe diner is exactly that-a true diner. It has never been updated. The menu has probably been the same for more than 25 years. But if your parking lots (they have 2) are filled that means you are doing something right. The cars were everything from old beaters to Porches. That says a lot as well. \\nWe will definitely be back to try other menu items!!'],\n",

Can we get extra onions with that?\\n\\nWe decided to give the lunch buffet a try, and arrived around 11:30 am. Sign on the door said hours were 11 am to whatever, but we got there to find the doors still locked.  I walked around the corner to see a studly guy standing outside the back door smoking, and asked if they were open. He looked at me surprised, and said he'd be right there. He came and unlocked the front doors, and in we went, past the muscle man with the cool brown eyes.\\n\\nWe were the first to arrive, and as I looked around the room(s) and I have to say it was kind of charming in that 1970's Soprano's kind of way. Like a mom and pop Italian place you'd expect to find somewhere in Jersey.  This is kind of living proof that Pittsburgh is indeed stuck in 1979, but in this case, in a GOOD way.

It basically contains a chafing dish of appetizers (this day had Clams Casino, some kind of fried mashed potato balls and fried zucchini), another with a pasta dish (tomato vodka today with fresh basil - VERY delicious), two meats (something like a beef brisket in one and the other a chicken cacciatore - the beef was excellent, as was the chicken), a small selection of salads (pasta, tossed, slaw and a bowl of beets), a tray of bread and rolls, and two different cakes for dessert.\\n\\nNow, even though we were the first to arrive, meaning early and the food was fresh, the chef and his trainee kept attending to the hot foods, showing sincere concern that it all stay fresh...and it did the entire time we were there. \\n\\nThe waitress was a very pretty 'woman' as opposed to the usual college student, and was extremely nice and helpful. The muscle man was apparently the bartender - ok - you can stand there and look pretty as long as you like.\\n\\nThey carried Pepsi products, so we ordered fresh brewed tea instead, and it was fine.\\n\\nTotal bill for two for a very satisfying lunch buffet was $20 and some change, very pleasant service AND eye candy, and a quaint trip down 'Scenes From An Italian Restaurant' meets 'Soprano's' memory lane.  \\n\\nI can't speak for dinner (yet) but if the food is as good, skip the pretentious Bistroids, and barking manager of Del's, and the potential gunfire from Pleasure Bar...and give them a shot.

I had gnocchi, she had Veal Imperial, and we ordered 'traditional style' which meant for an addition $4 it came with marinated mushrooms, Clams Casino, soup and salad. My friend left 1/3 of her veal dish on her plate and didn't want to take it home. I took a bite, and my tongue experienced absolutely no flavor, to the extent that I had to take a sip of my iced tea to see if I was getting a cold and losing my sense of taste. I could taste the tea. I could taste absolutely NOTHING from her veal.  With the gnocchi, I ordered the sausage, which was again $3 extra, and when it arrived it was a flat sausage patty cut in half, that tasted like a dry sausage McMuffin patty. The salad was basic iceberg lettuce and a few other veggies. The wedding soup had two tiny meatballs and about 1/3 cup of celery. The meal in general was a total disaster, but we ordered dessert anyway, and the tiramisu was still partially frozen. Then the bill came to over $82.  \\n\\nWe could not believe that we'd enjoyed the lunch buffet so completely, which was only $7.95, and that this dinner, as overpriced as it already was, was so completely void of flavor and character. \\n\\nIt's baffling to comprehend that an Italian restaurant that's been around as long as they have would still survive with these prices and total lack of quality for dinner. We had gone in with such high hopes.  But honestly, for dinner, it was such a huge let-down, we'll never go back. We'll go to the lunch buffet, but never to dinner.

       "  u'Tessaro\\'s is one of those quaint timeless neighborhood pubs/restaurants that so many soulless national chains spend millions of dollars trying to recreate.  It\\'s one of my favorite weekday after-work places to visit and I come here often.\\n\\nThe restaurant has a real hardwood grill that is is located in full view of the main dining room and baths the neighborhood with the smokey sweet smell of grilled meats that makes you salivate and your stomach ache for food.  It\\'s one of those things that makes you feel that this place is going to be great - you cannot wait to get inside and order.\\n\\nThe interior always has a great vibe.  High tin-covered ceilings, old-school wood bar, exposed red brick, and denim tablecloths cover tables that are closely-spaced and nearly always full with patrons happily eating and drinking.  Arrive at a peak time, any weekday or weekend evening, and you\\'ll likely be getting a drink at that nice bar while you wait for a table.  That\\'s OK - the bar is fully stocked, with local Penn Pilsner on tap (along with other good beers), and service is attentive and efficient.  Don\\'t forget to take a look at the chalkboard on the wall to see today\\'s specials.\\n\\nWhat to order:  You must try a burger here - I virtually guarantee that it will be one of the best you\\'ve ever had.  Tessaro\\'s grinds their beef for their burgers fresh daily, and they rely on their own recipe for their ground beef that mixes different cuts of beef in a predetermined proportion to achieve a balance of taste and the right amount of succulent fat - both for taste and for the right amount of drippings onto that hardwood fire which flares and sears the outside of the burger with tasty good stuff.  The burger is nicely-sized, with a great selection of cheeses and toppings, and grilled to your desired level of doneness.  This is the only restaurant where I frequently order a burger without any trimmings - just so I can taste the beef in all of its smokey goodness.\\n\\nA wish:  I wish they made better side dishes to accompany their burgers.  They offer some good side dishes: potato salad, steamed fresh vegetables; and some side dishes that could be better, especially the home fries, which tend to be soggy, greasy, and/or burnt.  They don\\'t offer french fries.  I think offering a proper french fry - made with freshly-cut potatoes, first par-fried at a lower temperature and then flash-fried at a very high temperature to order would go a very long way toward perfection.\\n\\nTheir soups are OK, and, strangely, a good portion of their menu is listed as \"Mexican\" fare.  They don\\'t need it, and would be better off limiting that fantastic hardwood grill to burgers, steaks, and fish specials.\\n\\nIf you haven\\'t visited yet, you will not be disappointed.

       "  u'Tessaro\\'s was both a passing point and my final destination on my hamburger road trip across America.  I\\'ve had famous burgers such as the ones at Mr. Bartley\\'s up in MA or the french bread burgers down at Rotier\\'s in Nashville as well as regional burgers like the green chili cheeseburgers of the southwest.\\n\\nAfter it all, I still see Tessaro\\'s as one of the best burgers I\\'ve had ever (my other top burger joints are scattered throughout the midwest where the beef is as fresh as fresh gets).  I started out with medium rare burgers when I first started going there, but eventually I toned down the knob to rare.  My cheese choice is always a slice of American.\\n\\nI typically like my burgers griddled with only burger bun and cheese, but since Tessaro\\'s serves up \"Pub Burgers\", I find it okay to eat with rabbit food (lettuce, tomato, onion).  Ketchup on a burger is blasphemy.  There is never a reason to add ketchup on a burger unless the burger is of poor quality.  Ketchup on a good burger is like heading to a prime steakhouse and asking for A1.  Save it for when you overcook your burgers at home or when you\\'re at McDonald\\'s.  Mustard is okay in reasonable quantities since its texture and taste complements the burger as opposed to covering it up.\\n\\nMy first thought was wow. These buns are huge. The top bun was awkwardly round and I had squish it a little to get a first bite that consisted of both burger and bun. It worked out in the end, as the buns were able to sop up all the excess beef juice without getting excessively soggy and difficult to hold. The patty itself was perfectly cooked. A full half pound of loosely packed coarse ground beef. I\\'m not sure what blend they use (definitely more than just chuck), but I want to guess around 75-80% lean, which is perfect in my book. The beef itself had an amazing texture and wasn\\'t heavily seasoned. The beef itself tasted remarkably fresh and just the right amount of \"beefy\". I usually order cheeseburgers over hamburgers as the slice of cheese makes the burger more forgiving to being overcooked and dry; however, at Tessaro\\'s, this was not the case. The slice of American cheese was perfectly melted and added the textural difference between the soft buns, the crisp lettuce, and the beefy patty. The lettuce and onions added additional contrast with their crunchy attributes, and the acidity from the two tomato slices balanced out the cheese. The soggy pickles were overshadowed by the red onion slices which offered not only a crunch but also a spicy kick, and I did not notice them at all.\\n\\nMy side choice is always home fries.  They come slightly charred and taste of delicious butter.  I had half my portion \"naked\" and paired the half with the traditional Heinz ketchup. Honestly they didn\\'t need the extra boost of flavor from the ketchup as they were amazing beforehand already. With the addition of the Heinz, the subtle tones of the char and butter were covered up, which was a pity.\\n\\nWhen you go to a steakhouse you order a steak.  When you go to a coffeehouse you order a coffee.  When you go to Tessaro\\'s you order a burger.'],\n",

The half rack is HUGE compared to some other places where I've tried ribs.

The wood fire grill gave a super flavor and both burgers were cooked perfectly to temperature.  My veggies were freshly steamed and looked like veggies, not a mush of frozen overcooked goop.

And I am never disappointed. \\n\\nI have heard grumblings for the past couple of years that Tessaro\\'s partially cooks their burgers throughout the day and then finishes cooking them \"to order\" so I asked the waitress if I could have a fresh patty, not pre-cooked.

You have to finish it with a fork.  \\n\\nThey don\\'t serve French fries, and they seem affronted when you ask for some.  This is a bizarre, given that everything else about the place screams \"we have fries here!\" Why withhold fries from customers who surely have been asking for them every day for years?

       "  u'I have to preface this review with two factors. One, I moved here from South Florida, where the best burgers in town came from your average diners.  They were the last bastion of American food in South Florida, so they served up REAL American food.  If you wanted a real burger, you went to a diner.  After returning to Pittsburgh, I found that every diner here has turned to serving up those frozen gray hockey puck patties and passing them off as burgers.\\n\\nSecond, (until the recent explosion of good burger joints in da burgh), I actually HAD been a fan of Tessaro\\'s, until their hostess/manager flat out offended the hell out of me and my party of three.  The result is that I have never, and WILL never return to Tessaro\\'s.\\n\\nMy best friend is a 62 y/o blind woman that I met doing theater in the 90\\'s in Pittsburgh.  She lives with her 91 year old mother, and her father (the driver) passed away several years ago.  I don\\'t drive, and rely on the bus system that Steve Bland is intentionally systematically destroying, so any outing that we make must be carefully planned.\\n\\nShe and I had met once at Tessaro\\'s.  It was her first time being there.  She took the Access van for the disabled, and I met her there after work via bus.  I walked in, she was seated, having a drink, waiting for me to join her. No problem.  We had a great meal, with an awesome burger.  I can\\'t say enough...they really do have mouthwatering burgers.\\n\\nMonths later, we decided to go again, and the plan was pretty much the same.  She took the Access van to the restaurant, and I was going to meet her by bus, and this time a new friend was going to join us, coming by bus from Oakland, and new to Pittsburgh.\\n\\nMy best friend called me at 4:30 (we were supposed to meet at 5) and said that her van had come early, and that she was already at the restaurant.  I told her I would get there as soon as I could.  I left work a few minutes before 5 pm, and arrived at the restaurant 5:15.  They were busy, but I was surprised to find my friend still standing in the doorway.  The blind woman had been standing there for 45 minutes.  \\n\\nI made my presence known, and the hostess/manager acknowledged, asked about our other friend. I explained that he was ten minutes away and coming by bus, new to the city, but WAS on his way.  She walked away from us.  We stood in the doorway fro another twenty minutes.\\n\\nFinally, the manager came back, and I caught her attention, and motioned my head toward my blind friend, and asked if we really had to keep waiting?  She\\'d been standing there in the doorway for over an hour.\\n\\nThe next statement sealed the deal on us never returning to Tessaro\\'s.  The manager slapped her hands on her hips, and started barking:\\n\\n\"LOOK!  We don\\'t have many rules around here!  In fact, we only have ONE, that you don\\'t get seated until your whole party is here!\"\\n\\nAnd THIS is what really sealed it:\\n\\nThe woman thrust her thumb in my BLIND friend\\'s direction, who had only been to Tessaro\\'s ONCE before in her life, with me, and said:\\n\\n\"And SHE oughta KNOW that!\"\\n\\nShe oughta know that?  Exactly HOW should she \\'know that\\'? The only other time she\\'d been there, she arrived before me, was seated, waited, and I joined her.\\n\\nAdditionally, the \\'rule\\' was posted...on a piece of 8 1/2 by 11 copy paper, taped to the wall at the end of the counter, behind several rows of water pitchers.  I couldn\\'t see the \\'rule\\'...a blind woman certainly wasn\\'t going to \\'see\\' it!\\n\\nFinally, after another ten minutes standing there, the manager \\'allowed\\' us to take a table and wait for our friend, who came five minutes later.

Who thinks that the white button down shirt with the little black tie works in 2012? The owners of Tessaro's do, which is part of the charm.\\n\\nIf you're in the mood for a tasty burger when you're in Bloomfield, you can't go wrong with Tessaro's. For my most recent lunch visit, I decided to change it up a bit and went for the cheesesteak with a side of boiled red potatoes.\\n\\nI chuckled when my food arrived. The cheesesteak was ridiculously large, overflowing with meat. The red potatoes came with a cup of melted butter for dipping. If you don't think potatoes should come with a cup of melted butter, honestly, you should go somewhere else... somewhere else where you can enjoy hating flavor. Personally, I assaulted those potatoes and didn't look back.\\n\\nThe cheesesteak was average. With some salt added, it was slightly above average. My advice to the kitchen would be to add some more salt and pepper while cooking to make it tastier out of the gate.\\n\\nTessaro's provides a classic Pittsburgh experience. While the food may only be worth three out of five stars, I'm going to add on another star because I like the fact that the dining room is dark, the menu is filled with meat, and the staff is friendly and efficient.

Don\\'t get me wrong, there may be better burgers in Pittsburgh, but I have yet to find them.\\n\\nTessaro\\'s has not only great burgers but also other foods that are delicious. Their menu is similar to what you would find in a steak house. They serve a lot of fish and steak aside from their burgers. After eating several different meals at Tessaro\\'s I can say with no doubt that my favorite thing there is the \"Bacon-Bleu\" burger with crumbled blue cheese (rather than creamy because they give you the opion). The bacon is amazing, the blue cheese melts to the bun within a coulple of minutes and the burger mean is so fresh that you can distinctly taste its freshness.\\n\\nThe ambiance of the place is really nice too. It is an older place which has kept that old Bloomfield feel still to this day. Everyone is extremely nice there. The owner is usually there at the door to greet you and is always willing to have a nice conversation with you in the time when she is not flying around trying to get people in their seats. \\n\\nThe only downfall with Tessaro\\'s and this is not their fault is that they are alway\\'s almost too busy. Because this place way a neighborhood bar at one point it doesn\\'t exactly have a lobby for you to wait in while you wait to be seated so that part of your dinner may be a bit uncofortable but all in all Tessaro\\'s will be a great experience, espescially for those who are a fan of the old fashion hamburger and beer.'],\n",

As a former resident of the small friendly neighborhood of Friendship I visited Tessaro's many times and always wondered why I ever ate a burger outside my own house anywhere else.  They are fantastic, the meat  mixture is juicy, fresh, and has tons of good beef flavor.  The buns are warm and don't mess with the top billing.  The toppings compliment, but never overpower and the side of home fries is perfect in a sublime sort of way.  By far my favorite combo for a Tessaro's burger is one with grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, bacon, provolone, and mayo.  Cliches be damned this is a God send for a mouth.  Smack that sucker on a plate next to grilled home fries and pour me an imperial ale because it's go time. \\nIf you're new to the Burgh or new to the boutique burger scene do yourself a favor and get over to Bloomfield for the reigning champ, Tessaro's.\"],\n",

When we showed up they only had booster seats. 3 years ago I wouldn't have known the difference, but after spending 2 minutes watching my 1.5 year old thrash around I can tell you their is a big difference. The waitress made it seem as though it was my fault for bringing him. Yelp says good for kids they said we have a high chair. The waitress was about as warm and friendly as a night in spent sleeping in the snow naked. The potato salad was awesome everything else was super sub par. The burgers are big and if you looking for a giant patty of cheap meat then this is your place. I feel bad because unlike most places I give two stars I really want to like this place.\"],\n",

Think about that.  A chicken, a cow, and a pig in between bread.  A new holy trinity?  Lovely indeed.  The burger was definitely juicy, and the egg yolk added a velvety texture.  You have a choice of sides, and opted for the standard home fries.  Paired with beer...you've got an American meal.\\n\\nAmbiance (8.0/10) = definitely a neighborhood joint.  Seemed like a lot of the customers were regulars.  Couple of TVs at the bar for sports.  \\n\\nService (8.5/10) = can't remember the name of our bartender/waitress, but very sweet lady.  \\n\\nOverall opinion = I've heard that this place has received awards for best burger in Pgh.  Not sure if I can share that opinion yet since I'm new to the city, however, there is no question that this place serves high quality classic juicy burgers.

Had I never heard of it before, it may have gotten an extra star. But, this restaurant was on the Pittsburgh's top 25 a few years back. This is supposed to be the best burgers in the 'burgh. If that were the case, I'd stick to making my own. \\nHubs and I stopped at T's on a recent Friday night after conducting some business in the area. Baby on board, we walked in and waited to be greeted. The inside looked a bit old and run down. Tip: they do not have highchairs only booster seats which is impossible to get a squirmy baby to stay in. I would not suggest bringing a baby here. The tables are also very small and close together. We actually had to move the table out to get in and out of the corner booth. I decided on the basic cheeseburger and ordered the boiled red skin potatoes for the baby and a side of chips for me fully expecting homemade chips. Not the case. I got a handful of what seemed to be a ruffles knock off. The potatoes were very bland despite being served with warm butter on the side. Great for a picky baby. Bad for an adult who is looking for something tasty. Now to the burger. Huge, yes. Juicy, not even close. Despite ordering my burgers well done, I expect them to still be tender and juicy. This was not the case. My burger was as dry as a burnt piece of chicken. I ate half of it. We were in a bit of a hurry so I didn't mention it to my server, though I'm not sure it would have made a difference seeing hubs medium burger was also dry. Overall, Tessaro's fell flat and left me hung out to dry.\"],\n",

Murals on the walls. Antique lighting. Lots of family mementos. I love each and every piece of it. \\n\\nAs far as the service goes I don't think they have hired a large portion of new staff since... ever. And that's ok with me. I love long time servers and bartenders who know everyone and treat you like family. When they get busy it may get a little slow but the service is always so pleasant I don't care. \\n\\nTessaro's does gave a full bar but don't go expecting new age hipster inspired mixology. It's definitely a simple bar from a simple time. Drink your manhattans, vodka martinis, wine and draft beer and be happy. \\n\\nThe big claim to Tessaro's fame is their burger. The burgers are fresh ground juicy and delicious. Also the Tuesday ribs are killer. It all comes down to the wood grill. It makes the whole neighborhood smell heavenly. \\n\\nTo finish up Tessaro's is a perfect example of old school. Everything about them just reeks of tradition.

Granted the burgers are delicious. \\n\\nGranted their burgers and other sandwiches do have tons of what you ordered to be on them.  Plus the bun itself is huge.  You do need two hands to enjoy your sandwich with.\\n\\nI love the way they cook their burgers on the hardwood grill.  As soon as you open the door you know that you are in the right place.'],\n",

The whiskey sour was spot on, and the alcohol content was spot on as well.  The cheesesteak was great, not particularly traditional, but great nonetheless.

Tessaro's doesn't have french fries on the menu, so home fries were my best bet. I think they also serve potato salad as a side, which I don't eat, so I didn't try any. But those who do like potato salad rave about Tessaro's. \\n\\nService was great, especially considering there were 6 of us and the place was crowded.

I really enjoyed the charred bites of the burger...some folks may not really appreciate this and it wasn't overwhelming, if it was I probably wouldn't have liked it.  But overall it reminded me of a great burger cooked at a BBQ!   \\n\\nOne thing I didn't realize is all the fixins come on the side for you to put on it such as the pickles, mustard, ketchup, mayo...it worked out though since I wanted a little of each.\"],\n",

I am sure that's where my love of Italian food came from.  Even going back farther than that, my parents went there in the 50's all the time. They knew the (owner?) Johnny Collinger and spent many a night having a good time there.  I remember Johnny still worked behind the bar when I went there as a kid in the 70's and he remembered me when I went there with my parents and would always make me a Shirley Temple with extra cherries in it.  (Good customer service is important to kids too! LOL)  So know that you know my family history with the PB, I will tell you that we just recently went back there with my mother who is now 84 on a recent trip back to PA.  The food was still very good but maybe not quite as good as I remember.  Nothing was bad and to be fair, we only split the eggplant parm sandwich and the meatball sub between the table.  The meatball sub was good, but I think the meatballs could have had a bit more flavor.  We also ordered an order of potato balls which used to be the family favorite back in the day. They were still good, but MUCH less cheese in the middle than in the past.  Pleasure Bar - add some more cheese to the potato balls and they will be a standout favorite on your menu and you could be famous for them.  I'd also like to see them bring back a past favorite sandwich called the PB Special. It was nothing more than a hamburger with Italian sauce on it and mozzarella cheese but the combination was outstanding.  I remember ordering that many times as a kid.  I like that fact that the bread is still made fresh (you can tell when you eat it).    The Pleasure Bar is still worth checking out for sure.\"],\n",

       "  u\"The Pleasure Bar is absolutely not a 5 star restaurant, but it gets 5 stars from me bc every time I've dined there I've left happy, full of delicious food, and not broke.\\n\\nEveryone in Bloomfield knows about the Pleasure Bar, but I'm not sure anyone outside of Bloomfield knows about it.  It's a small neighborhood restaurant, the main dining room is small and it looks like you're in the banquet room of a Holiday Inn in 1985--but somehow the atmosphere is warm and friendly instead of dated and depressing.\\n\\nI have never called ahead for reservations and i have never had to wait for a table and I believe this is only bc I've got lucky every time I dine there.  The restaurant is ALWAYS busy and for good reason--the food is great!\\n\\nIs this authentic Italian food?  I have no idea.  I have an Oma and a Nain (german and welsh grandmothers, respectively).  Many dishes were served at our house growing up, nary a Pasta Pomodoro among them.  So while I do not know if this is authentic Italian food, I can tell you this food is the real deal.  It's really, really good.\\n\\nHeres what we had to eat last night:\\n\\nthe tomato and mozzarella salad.  Its a real pet peeve of mine when restaurants don't use very ripe roma tomatoes for these kinds of salads.  The tomato NEEDS to be very ripe and acidic and I was initially disappointed when I saw just regular beef steak tomato's in the dish.  These were no ordinary tomatoes!  They were marinated and amazing.  The mozzarella came out in large slices, and the waitress had recommended I dress it with balsamic vinegar which I did and it was excellent.\\n\\nMy friend ordered the Italian wedding soup and I found it a little bland but he loved the soup.  It was the perfect ratio of pasta to broth and it was not heavy on the salt which is a good sign--you know the kitchen staff TASTES the food before serving it!  (not your food, they taste the food as it is prepared.  you know what I mean)\\n\\nI ordered the Salmon del Mare as my main course, it was the special of the night and it was very good.  Broiled salmon topped with tomatoes, spinach, mozzarella cheese, and shrimp scampi. I asked for my shrimp on the side and I am very glad I did because I think they might have overwhelmed the salmon.  I thought they'd just put the shrimp on the side but instead they brought out a delicious shrimp scampi which was good and savory and garlicky...  mmmmmmmmmm i just had a moment.\\n\\nthe salmon was cooked just right--where it flakes but it's still moist and it was seasoned perfectly.  All of the ingredients were cooked so well I ended up deconstructing my dinner, and I had the salmon without any of the toppings, and then ate the spinach and tomatoes as if they were their own side.  A side of broccoli came with the entree and it was good but kind of unremarkable.  I mean, it's steamed broccoli.  It really didn't have a chance, considering it was brought out with the shrimp scampi.\\n\\nMy friend ordered the Pasta Christopher which had red peppers, chicken, and sausage mixed in with penne.  Full disclosure:  I'm freaking hate Italian sausage.  I'm german (American by way of Stuttgart, my German claims are legitimate!  Stimmt!) and I HATE spicy sausages.  I like sausage bland, covered in Senf (mustard), and made of ingredients you don't want to know about.\\n\\nMy friend found the Pasta Christopher delicious.  You're not going to leave the Pleasure Bar hungry, where he usually cleans his plate he asked for a to go box. \\n\\nWe were too full to have dessert.\\n\\nOur check came to $50, but $14 of that was beer, we each had a beer with dinner.\\n\\nthis restaurant is reasonable, and delicious.  If you bring a date here, they wont be impressed but they will be relaxed, have a great dinner, and you're not going to go broke.\\n\\nI highly recommend this place and I wish more people knew about it.  it is one of my favorite dining options in Bloomfield.\\n\\n\\nGlossary:\\n\\nOma:  German for grandmother\\nNain:  Welsh for grandmother\\nStimmt:  True.  Correct\\nSenf:  German word for Mustard\"],\n",

Nice portions, good food, and classic Italian enviornment.\\n\\nWhen we got here, it was a pretty long wait, but luckily they have a pretty rocking bar here equipped with many TVs and plenty of booze.  Once we sat in the classic Itlaian looking dining area, our waitress came over, and we were starving.\\n\\nThe greens and beans were delicious.  I was suprised to find out it was only made with lettuces rather than traditional escarole, but it was delicious.\\n\\nEntrees were also great.  I ordered the half portion of salmon, so I can account for portion size there, but it was great!  Asparagus was delightful.  My parents both got a pasta dish, and there was plenty to share because these plates were packed.  \\n\\nI would definitley suggest this place.  You know it is a good deal when my dad gets the check and his first words are, \"That\\'s all?!\"  So with that being said, it is pretty affordable too.'],\n",

As if that wasn't bad enough the slow wait staff took about ten minutes to call the police and then proceeded to charge us for our mediocre meals even as they saw me telling the police how my wallet had been stolen under the waitstaffs not so watchful eye. Save your money and your wallet and go to wendy's the quality is far superior to this place.\"],\n",

Linguini Alfredo was supposed to be \"homemade\" but it was a far cry from the simple butter/cream/parmesan classic recipe. It was way too thick and absolutely tasteless. Also, my diet coke tasted funny and lack carbonation. My nephew ordered a grilled cheese and I thought they would use the local Sancholi bread, but no. ;(. It tasted like that yellow spray they use on grills. The waitress didn\\'t take the coke off of the bill until I asked. I think of this restaurant as a staple in the neighborhood. I hope that my experience tonight isn\\'t repeated.'],\n",

       "  u\"Ive been a fan of the Pleasure Bar from it the 60's ...it's current owners have kept some of the classic PB dishes,  along with their outstanding new menu.  \\nMy only complaint is that service is sketchy at best.  Having to ask for set ups, for water, for bread, for menus.....just turns me off.  Our party of 4 had a variety of entrees, all were good, but were missing 'something'.  Salad dressing was incorrect, soup was given to wrong person, cheese for pasta came after the dish was almost finished.  We were told that the larger beer glasses were dirty and we had to take a smaller glass!  The servers were frazzled, and surly....not a great combo.   So if you want a great meal in Bloomfield, and don't mind service that is sub par, try the PB.\"],\n",

       "  u\"Some friends and I were here Friday, August 22nd. It was very crowded due to Little Italy Days in Bloomfield. I didn't mind waiting 45 minutes for a table as it was busy, but they seemed really understaffed which was strange since it was Little Italy Days.\\n\\nOnce we were seated, we waited 15 minutes for our waitress Misty to greet us and take our drink orders. She complained about how busy they were and how this was the second double in a row she was working. She told us she was thinking of getting wasted that night and coming in the next day hungover... I can not stand when waitresses/waiters see that we're younger (I'm 25, my friends are in their early 30s) and assume that they can drop all professionalism and talk to us like we're their friends. I sympathize with you being slammed but I don't want to hear you complaining nor do I want to hear about you getting wasted. We should have requested another waitress at that moment.\\n\\nTwo other tables who were seated 10-15 minutes after us got their food about 20 minutes before us. Two other waitresses were working the room and seemed fast and competent. We were the only table with Misty, who was working both the bar area and us. She never checked on us, took forever to get our food to us (which I'm assuming was sitting back in the kitchen for quite some time) and after we finished, we sat there for 20 minutes before we finally flagged down the hostess for our check. From the time we walked in to the time we walked out was a little over 2 hours. Would never consider going back.\\n\\nThe food was good.\"],\n",

Went back in August on a Friday and asked if we could sit outside at one of the tables in front,  bartender told us yeah but we would have to come inside to order things because it\\'s too busy. There were nine people in the bar section. It was nice out so we sat out there anyway. When our food was ready she knocked on the window and I had to go in to the bar and bring our food out to the table,  so it\\'s got a nice authentic touch of waiting your own table yet paying someone else to do it. Eventually realized that she was doing this because she was screwing a waitress out of the table and didn\\'t want to be seen. Classy. \\n\\nSame one was working the last time we went,  it was dead and she still couldn\\'t keep up. Everything she said to anyone was prefaced with \"give me a second I have to get this for these people first\"  and then she would look at her phone. I mean I don\\'t expect the best service on a Friday night somewhere but when it\\'s dead and you can\\'t even come close to keeping up what the hell are you doing. \\n\\nOn the bright side we got bread with our meal for the first time in the last four visits this time so....  progress I guess.

We arrived at 7:20pm and were told there would be a 20 to 30- minute wait; we finally got a table after almost an hour.   Over the course of the next 90 minutes we received some bread,  some cabbage water with a few little meatballs,  one odd- smelling cloudy iced tea,  and numerous claims that the food would be \"right out\".  After a two-and a half hour bout of frustration we had enough and went home hungry.   \\n\\nI will never go here again.   The little bit of food that we had was awful,  and we never got or entrees.

This place is CHEAP.  We started out with the bruschetta, which was ok.  Not my favorite, but I think it was four huge slices of bread and covered in garlic and tomatoes.  It was a bit greasy for my tastes but still yummy.  Then, we split the stuffed shells ($8.50) and gnocchi ($9).  Both were fantastic, I'm guessing homemade.  Other trips we have tried manicotti, deep-fried zucchini, and all sorts of other things.  The portions are a good size, and you might even have a very small portion of leftovers.\\n\\nThe service is slow considering we are often the only people on a Saturday at lunch time, but who cares?

A friend of mine is a regular there and it came highly recommended. \\n\\nI have to be in the mood for Italian, but it was really good. Friend had the chicken noodle soup, which I had a taste of, and it was delicious. Ranch dressing is my default condiment, and theirs is to die for. I was dipping bread in ranch after I had finished my salad. Speaking of, the Italian bread was fresh and delicious. Even the butter was great, despite coming from those little containers with the peel off top. Then we had the potato balls. Come on, you can't go wrong with balls of fried potatoes and cheese. They were really good. I had chicken parm and couldn't believe the size of it. After bread, salad, and potato balls, I was only able to eat about 1/4 of it. While it was good, I thought that my friend's carbonara was better. That's what I'll be getting next time. \\n\\nI ordered stuffed shells with a meatball to take to my mom. She used to frequent Pleasure Bar in her younger days and said the food is as good as it was back then. I also got her a slice of chocolate cake, which she loved, although it's more of a dark chocolate. \\n\\nService was great, but to be fair, it wasn't busy at 6pm on a week day.

His entree came with a wedding soup that was ok...but when the server brought it, the crackers fell to the worn, dirty carpet and she picked them up and put them on the table...gross. Our food took forever and when it got there I was highly disappointed. My Alfredo was tasteless. No salt or cheese, just a bland b\\xe9chamel. The shrimp were clearly previously frozen as well as the \"scallops\" that were tiny and rubbery. The veal was soggy and chewy and the sauce was sub par. We tried to push through but couldn\\'t.

The room was spacious with plenty of room for the four of us, no crusty stains and pretty clean smell. The bathroom was large with a single sink outside the room so one person could get ready while another showered (or puked their pants off in my case). The room could have used more mirrors to make it a little easier for me and the other girl to get ready without rubbing our butts together at the sink area, but I guess it was fine since I came down with some form of the plague over the weekend and no amount of primping was going to make me look like a respectable human anyway.  \\n\\nThe area the hotel is in seemed like a pretty central one for happening things and not too terribly far from ish, but their $20 nightly parking fee adds up. We're cheap so we opted to save our wallets from being raped of any Andrew Jackson's and parked at the meters surrounding the Marriott that run from 9-6pm each day. Just remember to set your alarm so you can have your quarters in the meter before the clock strikes 9am EST or you'll end up forking over $20 for a parking violation anyway, and the hipster meter maid man in this area was noticeably diligent. On Sundays the parking on Aiken right across from the Marriott and in front of that church is free, so we made it a point to snag a spot there so we could sleep in on our last day of Pittsburgh-ing. \\n\\nThey have an indoor pool, free coffee and computers usage in the lobby, free wi-fi throughout the whole hotel and conference rooms should you need that sort of thing for work as well. I had checked out a few hotels and rates before we went and for what we got and how almost-stain-free** the place was, this Marriott seemed world's better than the rest of the lot in our affordability price range \\n\\n** I (accidentally) left my signature Candice calling card, an orange-stained pillowcase. Sorry, Housekeeping! A little bit of bleach and that sh*t should come right out.\"],\n",

We had to get out- my boyfriend was in school at the time and had a final the next day. There was no way we would get any sleep. \\n\\nWe called around 5 to see if they had any rooms and quickly booked one with a king sized bed. Check-in was a little tedious because the system was down but I pulled up my confirmation email and it was fine. We skipped the valet and found street parking. \\n\\nOur room was spacious and clean.

       "  u'Walking into your hotel room can either be one of the simpler joys in life, or a straight-up horror show. Thankfully, my experience with Courtyard Pittsburgh Shadyside was the former.\\n\\nMy first reaction was, \"Wow, this room is huge.\" For $179 a night (part of a wedding room block, so unsure if this is discounted or not), we got a queen bed with a nice sized living area (couch, chair, coffee table, desk, etc.), and a balcony overlooking the city. The bed was situated in such a way that it has you looking straight out those sliding glass doors once you\\'re all tucked in - a really nice setup for a Courtyard. And above all, super clean. Even the wi-fi was fast and free, and therefore, fantastic. I was impressed.\\n\\nSo much so that I can more or less forgive the slew of minor annoyances/inconveniences/nitpicks/whathaveyou. They are, in no particular order:\\n\\n- No room service and the food court-type restaurant in the lobby holds limited operating hours.\\n- Despite the size of the rest of the room, you\\'ve got tight quarters in the sink area outside the bathroom. Ladies, before you get all dolled up, you\\'ve been forewarned.\\n- Slow. Ass. Elevator. My. God.\\n- Busy, construction-plagued intersection surrounding the hotel.\\n- Mandatory valet. This place is nice, but not nice enough for mandatory valet. Just sayin\\'.\\n\\nAgain, these bullets should be taken with a grain of salt as the alternatives are more \"nice to haves\" rather than \"musts\" when checking off boxes for prospective hotels. At least, for me. As you can see from the rating, the good here more than outweighed the, well, not bad - let\\'s just say, slightly annoying.\\n\\nIf you have reason to stay near Shadyside versus downtown, this is your hotel. But hey, if you have business downtown and just wanna stay here anyway, have at it - the hotel has a free shuttle to bring you there, if you\\'re so inclined. For a short stint in Steel City, CPS is a solid spot.'],\n",

       "  u\"This was an experience that was more than a 2, but I would find another hotel next time so I don't feel like I can give it a 3. \\n\\nFirst, mandatory valet parking is an annoyance. We are not downtown, and charging $17.88 to park is a lot at a $129 a night hotel. They do have a shuttle that you can use to go to areas within a few miles and its a good thing because there is not much to walk to in the general area.  \\n\\nThe closest things in waking distance are about a 1/2 mile away--but it is higher end chain-shops like the Apple Store and Athletica. I'd certainly walk a half mile for some unique, non chain shopping. But this was not what I had in mind. \\n\\nThe room was a good size, clean and mostly ok. With 2 queen beds there was not much leg room for other seating options. \\n\\nThe HVAC unit was very loud and it rattled. The toilet had a hard time and required 2 flushes per visit.  The shower was weak, but had a Speakman head. \\n\\nBut the bed was a big disappointment. The mattress was borderline uncomfortable. The linens were not very substantial, and the pillows were cheap and sponge like.  \\n\\nThe nightstand was unstable. When the drawer opened fully it toppled over. Poor design not helped by the heavy bibles--one regular and the Book of Mormon always present at any Marriott. \\n\\nAlso of note is that the hospital across the street must be, like all hospitals, a no smoking campus. With a Starbucks in the lobby of the hotel, there were always 4 to 10 smoking-slobs in and around a bench next to the hotel entrance giving the Courtyard a  flop-house like feel. \\n\\nI will say that the staff was great. Nice, helpful and ever present. \\n\\nI was not expecting the Ritz, but the actual accommodations were more like Holliday Inn/Hampton Inn and those properties are less money--again, we were at 129 with a big discount, so most customers are paying 150 per night and this was not in that price range in terms of quality. \\n\\nSince this location (and Pittsburgh's lack of an easy to use public transit system) requires a car, this was not a cheap hotel stay. We are normally Starwood people, and Marriott did little to sway my view that Starwood is a better brand, if for no other reason than the Sheraton mattress at every property--even Four Points which is equivalent to Courtyard. \\n\\nFor reasons that are unclear to me, Pittsburgh in general is expensive for hotels. All the Sheraton properties were more money, but given the reality on the ground I can see why.\"],\n",

       "  u\"I would not stay here, it's not worth the money they charge. Going through other reviews (here and on other sites), it seems some of the issues I had were not new or happening for the first time; this to me indicates they don't have the willingness or resources to maintain their rooms properly.\\n\\nIn order of appearance, here are the issues I had during my two night stay:\\n\\n- The minifridge had a former guest's leftovers still in it\\n\\n- The TV would sometimes not work-- rather, only the sound would work, but the screen would remain black. I'd have to turn it off and on again and that would do the trick usually\\n\\n- Their HVAC system was fairly loud IMO\\n\\n- Each side of the bed comes with a nightlight with an integrated power outlet. The power outlets were, in my opinion, shoddily installed; which meant that after plugging in my phone charger and leaving it on for the entire night, my phone did not fully charge. I discovered the only way to get it to charge was to manually hold the charger against the outlet, which I can do for a few minutes but after a while... it gets old. I didn't have problems plugging my charger in any other outlet, just the ones by the bed.\\n\\n- Yellow/brownish water! My room came with an awesome jacuzzi. Following instructions, I filled the jacuzzi with water, only to discover the water was yellow. First I thought the lighting in the room might be making it *look* yellow... but no, the water was actually quite yellowish/brown. I compared a glass of water taken from the jacuzzi to one taken from the sink area and the difference was noticeable. So if you do stay here, be on the lookout for the color of your water. But, not all jacuzzi hope is lost: I emptied the jacuzzi and re-filled it and the water looked more clear the second time. Hooray!\\n\\nSo those were the bad things. Now for the good:\\n\\n- Great customer service. The front desk was always very nice and polite and they had no problem with quickly getting me a blanket moments after I requested one (I felt cold in the room)\\n\\n- Convenient shuttle service. It only moves within a few miles of the hotel (so it won't take you or pick you up from the airport, unfortunately) but it was free, super useful to get around the city, and the drivers were friendly and knowledgeable about the area\\n\\nI should note that none of the problems I had were insurmountable (though yellowish water and strangers' leftovers are off-putting) and had it happened at a different price point, the customer service would have made up for it. But having paid $500 to stay there for 2 nights, I was pretty disappointed.\"],\n",

       "  u\"Three words: Cheap water ice!\\n\\nAfter a walk in Allegheny Cemetery yesterday afternoon (Memorial Day), CM and I were hot.  After checking to ensure that I had cash, I suggested that we stop by for a cool treat, and he assented.  Fortunately, when we pulled up and parked, I saw a sandwich board sign on the sidewalk stating that they were open.  Hooray!\\n\\nMy original plan was to order a cone of soft serve ice cream and have it dipped in chocolate topping and then in sprinkles.  However, the woman working told me they didn't have chocolate topping (?!?), so I had to change my plans.  CM was intrigued by the water ice (Italian ice), since he'd never had any, and decided to order one.  I decided to do the same, since I'd been looking for an alternative to Rita's (bleh!), but water ice is surprisingly difficult to come by in the Burgh.  I asked the woman what brand it is, and she informed me that it's Hershey's (I wasn't even aware that Hershey's made water ice, but apparently, they do, and it's sold under the Via Venetto label.)\\n\\nFor our water ices, CM ordered watermelon flavor, and I ordered tie dye, a combination of lemon, lime, and blue raspberry flavors.  The tie dye was a nice combination of tart and sweet flavors, but I wasn't a huge fan of the watermelon, since it tasted rather artificial to me.  The texture was velvety, as is appropriate for water ice, and it was cold enough that it didn't melt quickly.  Best of all, the price was right ($2.14 w/ tax for a small)--a dollar cheaper than Rita's, which is overpriced IMO, and with comparable or better quality.  (I'll have to see if I can get them to make a gelati!)\\n\\nOddly, despite the claim that they didn't have chocolate topping, I saw a kid with a cone that appeared to be dipped in just that.  I'll have to try ordering that again next time to see if this was a fluke.  Regardless, I'll definitely be stopping back here soon to get another fix of cheap, delicious water ice!\"],\n",

I love the corner building, the way it looks out onto Liberty Ave. It looks so welcoming. Especially in the summer. Outdoor seating, always pretty well packed with people.\\n\\nI\\'ll come right out and say that the crowd that frequents Silky\\'s isn\\'t my usual crowd, but unlike some bars I\\'d never had an issue with someone wanting to start a fight with us because we look like a bunch of dirty malcontents. This place is just not our usual dive bar.\\n\\nThursday night my boyfriend texted me that he was there with a mutual friend. Living less than a city block from there I headed over. I needed a beer and some hockey/world series action to distract me after the Halloween parade. It was as busy as usual. A few seats remaining and I managed to snag one right at the bar, front and center.\\n\\nI hate to say this because I don\\'t remember this happening years ago when I went there. I was not even acknowledged. I get flagging down a bartender in a crazy busy bar in the South Side on a Friday night. I don\\'t like it but I get it. This was a moderately steady Thursday night. I wasn\\'t standing behind the people\\'s sitting at the bar. I was the person sitting at the bar. There were two male bartenders both bartenders asked the guy next to me multiple times if he wanted anything else to drink. \\n\\nBy \"multiple times\" I mean 6 or 8 times. The person sitting directly beside me. They wouldn\\'t look at me. I tried to make eye contact with either of them and it was as if I wasn\\'t even there. Eventually the boyfriend\\'s beer emptied as well. This is about 20 minutes after I arrived. I\\'ve had people walk in and stand behind us and the bar tender or waitress was on them immediately. After another 5 minutes of the boyfriend\\'s beer being perched precariously on the edge of the bar and the bartenders standing there chatting he had to ask the bartender for a refill and if I could have a drink.\\n\\nThe bartender looks up at him, grabs his pint glass angrily from the bar and says, \"Oh, you wanted another?\" \\n\\nReally? I was so angry at that point that it took everything I had not to ask the guy what his issue was.  I later saw him drop a pint glass and stumble into something so many he was drunk.\\n\\nThe food that other people ordered smelled and looked great. Even the seafoody bits which I normally hate smelling. The tv\\'s are plentiful and newer.

       "  u\"A solid neighborhood bar, just a short walk from my workplace.  My coworkers and I went out here after work.  It's a nice little cozy environment that just has a comforting feel to it.  Plenty of flat screen TVs to catch the big game, though not sure what their channel options are for out of town games.  I'd have to go back to investigate.  Otherwise, the service was solid, the drink menu was decent, and the food was good.  I had the nachos which were pretty average to slightly above average in nature.  The guacamole was actually good though.  Nothing to write home about, but decent enough to enjoy.  And yes, I'm a stickler when it comes to guac.  Overall, I'm giving this place 4 stars because this is simply a cool place to chill after a long day at work.  Give it a try and see what you think.\"],\n",

       "  u\"Over the years Silky's or The 'Chester as my friends and I call it (from Shaun of the Dead) has become our go to bar.  This is for few reasons.\\n1.  The atmosphere and staff are exactly what we look for in a place.  Silky's balances the line between trendy, divy, and sporty all at once and actually pulls it off.  They have a few TVs which always is showing the big game and usually has good specials during Penguin and Steeler games. Silky's also boasts a shuffleboard table and darts to keep people busy and having fun.  The shuffleboard is a must to try.\\n2.  The beer and food are grade A bar quality.  Nothing pretentious here, just good wings, a huge burger, and unique selections.  The beer list isn't huge, but they do carry a few microbrews and some of the local swill.  \\n3.  No smoking.  \\nSilky's in Bloomfield also has plenty of tables and bar stools and isn't over run with drunk yinzers it attracts a mix of college students, young professionals, and old dudes from the Bloomfield area.  \\n\\nIf you're searching for a new bar to have some food, play some games, and drink a beer look no further than The 'Chester.\"],\n",

Tonight, we sat outside and our waitress (Nikki) walked past us four times without making eye contact.  In fairness, I dont think it\\'s an issue with the waitress being bad as much as they really need to hire more waitresses, bc it seemed like there was only one waitress for the entire restaurant.\\n\\nOur tabletop was sticky and so after waiting for 20 min for service I decided I really needed a drink and went inside.  The bartender (Olivia) did not want to serve me bc we were sitting outside.  \"Your waitress will be right with you.\"  me:  \"But you are here now, can I please have a Shocktop Wheat?\"  \"Ill tell the waitress.\"  me:  \"Please may i just have my beer?\"  She served me, but then the waitress walked up to me and was like, \"Oh, I didn\\'t see you, weren\\'t you outside?\"  If you didn\\'t see me how would you notice I was outside?\\n\\nIts ok, I felt bad for her bc she was so busy but like--I\\'m easy to please.  All I needed was a beer.  I got one, so the waitress and I were then \"cool.\"  She then proceeded to never come back to our table, but that\\'s ok i think we pissed her off.\\n\\nThis has been a common thread:  not enough waitstaff so you have to beg for your food or drinks when the wait staff does come by.  It\\'s extremely frustrating.\\n\\nThe time before last we were there we ordered food and the waitress told us that we could expect to wait over an hour bc they had a group of 15 come in.  We thought she was kidding, and had our beers, so we rolled with it but she was not kidding.  We waitied over an hour for our food and the waitress made no apologies.  Also, our friend came and ordered food before ours came out, and this was around 10:30.  after waiting and waiting and waiting we asked the waitress for an ETA on his burger, but it turned out she forgot to put it in, and hte kitchen had closed.\\n\\nThe service sucks but what really sucks is the staff is never apologetic about it bc this place is a neighborhood bar w locals so they kind of dont care about apologizing bc they know you\\'ll be back.\\n\\nBut I come here bc like I said the food is ok, but you\\'ve got to come here and be very very patient.'],\n",

I have been disappointed several times when the tap list has changed but not the menu. I get my heart set on a beer, only to find out the keg has been tapped. No complaints though, there is always something else to try. \\n\\nI haven't had much food here, but the waffles fries are a great candidate for a late night bite.\\n\\nSilky's has several dart boards, and a shuffle board table along the window.

I checked Yelp and saw that this place had some decent reviews, so thought I would give it a try.  There weren't too many people there when I walked in, so I went right up and sat at the bar.  I was greeted right away by the bartender (Bill).  He told me which three beers he was out of (which unfortunately were the three best ones on draft), then took my order.  I started with some wings and a beer.  I only order a half dozen of the atomic flavored wings which was unfortunate, as they were some of the best wings I've had in quite a while.  As a comparison, they weren't as hot as Buffalo Wild Wings 'hot' wings, but had decent heat and great flavor.  I then had another beer and ordered a meal they had on special.  It's not what I would call bar food by any means, as it was a perfectly cooked baked chicken with vegetables and potatoes.  I got a cup of cheddar and lager soup as part of the meal too which was wonderful.\\n\\nOverall, I was glad to stumble across this place.  As others mentioned, it seemed to tailor to an older crowd (30-49 seemed to be the median age when I was there).  I would have given it 5 stars had they been fully stocked on their draft beer.

All that changed when my boyfriend and I decided to check it out for Sunday dinner one evening. We were very hungry and seeking a nice little neighborhood pub sort of place near our new house. I'm happy to say Silky's ended up being just what we were hoping to find!\\n\\nIt was dark and sort of cozy-feeling inside when we walked in. I liked how chill the vibe was. We immediately seated ourselves at a table to wait for the server. This might be a random observation, but I really appreciated the size of the tables for two. They could have probably fit four people but with only two seats it felt like there was actually enough room for plates and drinks and such. One of my biggest annoyances with eating at bars is getting an extraordinarily small, wobbly table. Our waitress came over pretty quickly and provided us with the draft list and specials for the night. The beer choices weren't amazing but certainly adequate for a neighborhood place. I ended up ordering the California chicken wrap with regular fries, and my boyfriend got chicken fingers with waffle fries. I absolutely loved my wrap and fully intend to order it again! It had guacamole, (an all too rare thing to find in wraps or sandwiches in Pittsburgh) bacon, general chunks of grilled chicken, and tomatoes. Those are four of my favorite foods, so I was very pleased with my choice. I eat my wraps with a knife and fork so I had no trouble with the messiness factor, but the wrap was quite large and I had leftovers for the following day. I enjoyed my boyfriend's waffle fries a little more than my plain ones however, so I'll probably get those next time. He said his chicken fingers were great. I'm sure we'll be back at Silky's very soon. Delicious food, awesome service, and close proximity to our home will make this a regular spot for the two of us.\"],\n",

After only about three minutes a technician came in and told me a nice little story about how my car needed synthetic oil.  And that they were going to charge me $70 for it.  Funny thing was that I had my oil changed before and no one ever told me it NEEDED synthetic oil.  Lies.  When I refused to pay that amount they promptly said that they could knock off $15.  I'm sorry, but $55 is still more than what was quoted to me on the phone.  They then wanted me to sign a waiver to put in regular oil.  I just had to look at them and ask if they heard me.  I again refused, went to work, and found a more reliable place with a better price.\"],\n",

He basically denied any possibility that it could be related to anything they had done, and tried to tell me that my car just happened, coincidentally, to be having some other problem. Finally, he agreed to let me pull up front and hook my car up to the diagnostic machine. They got back a vague error code (p0420 - catalytic efficiency below threshold), denied any responsibility, and sent me on my way. I'm down $50 and still don't know what's wrong with my car.

But since I was already there and my weekend plans are packed I reasoned that the $45.95 posted was a small enough fee for the convenience. The gentleman told me it would be about 45 minutes.

The sweet potato fries are as good as advertised and the dipping sauce could be consumed with a straw but the TV selection leaves a little to be desired. I understand it is a PITT bar but with 95% of the bar focused on the LSU/Alabama game you would think they could have moved the PITT game to a corner TV and use the center TV with sound for the majority of the bar that was concerned in the 'Epic' game. They did switch the games around while PITT was at half but as soon as that game started the LSU game was back relegated to the corner. The manager even made some comment that our group didn't appreciate but whatever it's not like I will be back anytime soon. If you are looking for some good bar food I say stop on by.

The menu is predominantly sandwiches and wraps but the selection is VERY good. There are dinner entrees as well and I've ventured there a few times and was pleasantly surprised.. But the sandwich is king here. Oh yeah, I like 'em!! The jerk chicken with pineapple, provolone, and roasted red peppers is a HUGE hit. The crab cake sandwich is amazingly good - who would have thought?? The jalapeno steak wrap is so good I have a hard time straying from that. I've had about half the list and can tell you I've never regretted my choice. All very good. And they're not shy about size. You'll get full. I've tried their soups too and they're delightful and rich. Another winner. But I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the fries. Not just typical bar fries, but superb, specialty fries. Your choices are cajun, regular or sweet potato. The Cajuns are coated in a spicy dusting of Cajun seasoning. Yum. The sweet potato fries come with a brown sugar butter dipping sauce that will have you smacking your lip for hours afterwards. You'll wake up dreaming about that sauce. Addicting.

The bar and a few tables are in the front while several more tables for dining line the back area.\\n\\nIt was nearly empty.  We were there late -- from about 10-11pm -- on a freezing cold Tuesday night.  A young couple sat quietly at the bar, another guy in the corner chatted up the bartender, and I grabbed a seat a little further down the bar.

She had a Guiness, I had another Festivus, we chatted about this and that.  It was quiet, low key, and comfortable.  It\\'s a place that looks really nice yet had a friendly almost dive-y vibe.  I was only there for an hour and no one else was really there, so I shouldn\\'t jump to conclusions.  However, I will definitely be plopping myself down at that classic bar again in the near future, and who knows, maybe Lot 17 will become my neighborhood go-to spot for grabbing a beer on a whim.\\n\\nThere was a new, shiny, fancy looking, electronic jukebox that I will definitely have to give a try next time!

I've also had the crab cake sandwich which is pretty darned fantastic, too. The jalape\\xf1o steak wrap is so delicious and spicy that it also ranks near the top of delightful choices. It's real steak cooked to order inside, too. The fish tacos are also a tasty option.\\n\\nI'm not much of a French fry eater unless I'm at Lot 17. Their sweet potato fries are served with a side of brown sugar honey butter dipping sauce that I wish I could make at home. Tried and failed many times. It's the perfect compliment and I now refuse to get sweet potato fries anywhere else because I'd just flat out miss that sauce too much! Occasionally it shows up runny or less than perfect & I get sad but its still better than my best attempt to copy it.\\n\\nBeer selection is good but could be more extensive. We've sampled some of the items off the appetizer menu in our early days coming here and realized they were totally unnecessary based on the amount of food you receive off the sandwich menu. We did manage to score some free chicken wings by texting Lot 17 using a sign on our booth once. Fun!\\n\\nOverall, love this bar. We've continually had good service, the food comes out quickly & the prices are reasonable.\"],\n",

       "  u\"Been going here for YEARS and just love it. Love it! Time to update! It's always an option on a Saturday afternoon when we're thinking of someplace to go to have an early dinner, late lunch or just grab a sammie and some beer. And it's a 30 minute drive for me! The service has always been good and we've never had an issue. We love the sandwiches and the wraps - my fave is the jalapeno steak wrap, although lately it seems that they've had too much wrap and not enough steak. But it IS real steak, not Steak-ums. That isn't always the case at other places.\\n\\nBut you can't go wrong - the Lot 17 salad is killer good. And the Jerk Chicken sandwich with the grilled pineapple is my wife's favorite. Not to mention the amazing sweet potato fries and the crack-like brown sugar butter dipping sauce. Always a good rotating selection of good beers and I'm always happy to choose among several I would drink anytime. In fact, I'm getting a strange craving for that steak wrap and some crack butter....\"],\n",

       "  u'My husband and I visited on a quiet Friday afternoon, and we were politely greeted by the bartender. We each ordered a beer and were promptly served. After taking a moment to glance over the menu, we decided on the pita pizza app, the special (beer battered fish/Mac and cheese) and the fish tacos. \\nThe pita pizza: a soft pita shell with pesto, tomatoes, chicken and cheese. BORING. \\nThis appetizer reminded me of my mother\\'s Irish cooking: tasteless. A simple addition of caramelized onions would have solved this problem. \\nEntree 1: Beer battered fish and Mac and cheese. Ruling: BLAND. My husband ordered this one and described the fish as \"wet\" and the Mac and cheese as \"play-doh\". They also served the dish with lettuce, tomato and onion, as if it were a sandwich. \\nEntree 2: Fish tacos. Ruling: OVERCOOKED/COVER-UP ATTEMPTED. Ok, so they weren\\'t bad, but the fish was dry. Covered with tomatoes and a bit of lettuce, the tacos were, again, on the tasteless side. The attempt at adding flavor came with the chipotle mayo and sour cream. \\nThese only helped to moisten the fish. The corn relish was masked by jalape\\xf1o peppers and the rice came shaped as if out of a small flowerpot.\\nThe service was quite friendly, so, no fault there. The chef, however, needs a bit of training.'],\n",

Nothing to necessarily write home about, but whenever my boyfriend and I need a meal in a pinch we head here.  The service is always great- fast and friendly- and the prices are more than reasonable for what you get.  Some of my favorites on the menu are the buffalo chicken sandwich, blackened mahi sandwich (ask for extra seasoning!), and the reuben.  The homemade chips and cajun fries for sides are great compliments to anything on their menu.\\n\\nFor an extra incentive to try it out, you can purchase a $50 \"hot card\" for just $25 through PG Daily Deals (http://deals.post-gazette.com/) and use it here or at any one of about 30 participating restaurants... just look for whatever restaurant they are featuring with the hot card to get one!'],\n",

Lot 17 worked with us to plan this mixer for our members, and they were extremely accommodating and eager to help us make the event a success. The upstairs space is the perfect setting for a small to medium-sized gathering, and the appetizers we ordered were delicious.

It got packed quickly once the game started as lot 17 is a true \"pitt\" bar. Service at the bar was very prompt and friendly despite them being very busy. We started off with an order of garlic jerk wings which were very tasty. Not overly spicy or garlicky and cooked perfectly crisp. I later ordered the Rachael with sweet potato fries. My boyfriend ordered the Reuben with Cajun fries.they have several other menu items that looked good: a salmon blt, crab cake sandwich, turkey club on focaccia, and many burgers that are very good from what my boyfriend says. The Rachael was really good- the rye was marble which I prefer. The sweet potato fries were served with a honey butter that was amazing! He liked his Reuben a lot and the Cajun fries were good but too spicy for my tastes. Beer selection is really stellar too- lots of good craft drafts.

       "  u\"This is my boyfriend's favorite place to catch Pitt basketball/football so we have made many appearances here since the last time I wrote a review and I have since tried some of the items I was interested in before. Menu items I have tried since my first review:\\n1. Turkey club on focaccia (Our own oven roasted turkey breast, bacon, and Swiss cheese with lettuce and tomatoes served with a roasted garlic mayonnaise on focaccia) $8.50\\n2. Salmon BLT (Grilled salmon served on hoagie roll with dill mayo, bacon, lettuce, and tomato) $12.00\\n3. Grilled chicken wrap (Chicken breast, sundried tomatoes, olives and feta cheese wrapped in a spinach tortilla with balsamic dressing) $9.00\\n4. Calamari (Fried calamari served with peppers, onions, marinara sauce and lemon) $9.00\\n\\nMy favorite out of these would be the chicken wrap, although I wish the dressing was already inside the wrap because the wrap was packed so tightly it was difficult to get the dressing ratio right in the wrap. The turkey club also had a lot of flavor to it as well and the garlic mayo gave it a nice touch. The salmon BLT was not as good as the ones I have had at Piper's Pub but still adequate. I'm not a huge calamari fan so it was just ok for me. We will for sure be back in the future since this is a gathering place for my boyfriend and some of his friends.\"],\n",

       "  u\"This is more of an update to let everyone know Lot 17 has added several new menu items and I highly recommend returning (or making your first trip there) to check some of them out.  As far as apps go,  I tried the pot roast nachos this past weekend and if anyone is familiar with Atrias version (which is awesome-check those out too), this version is highly comparable. The jalepenos add a nice kick and the chips didn't become overly soggy from the meat, which was very tender. Sour cream and salsa are served on top and an order is huge-easily feeds 4 people. \\nThey have a couple of new sandwiches as well, a roasted Italian vegetable sandwich (I did not try this so can't really speak on the quality) and a smothered pot roast sandwich described as pulled short ribs with a marsala mushroom and\\nonion sauce topped with swiss cheese on a rustic roll. This was so juicy and flavorful and plenty to eat the next day too. There's also a new southwest turkey wrap (lettuce,tomato, corn salsa, fresh turkey, bacon and chipoltle ranch). The chipotle ranch added just the right amount of kick and I loved that the turkey they used was of the carvery style. I took half of this home and it was good reheated the next day. They also have a new short rib mac and cheese entree and a pretzel crusted salmon dish, one of which I will be getting on my next visit. Service was excellent as usual-Adrienne, whom I'd never had as a server there before, was quick to continuously serve with a smile. And it wasn't overly crowded on a Saturday night which was another plus. I'll return most likely sooner than later.\"],\n",

Also the sandwich did not stick together like a melted sandwich should. Ugh. The zucchini planks were delicious. 1 out of 3 is not great. My sister raved about this place. I am so disappointed.

Even though it is clearly a locals place (four people came and went whose food came without ordering it), the owner couple were welcoming and chatty. I heard all about their thanksgiving. They were closed Thursday and Friday to serve or deliver 300 meals to the needy in their community. 130 deliveries and others picked up.

       "  u'I am beyond happy to finally review this sandwich shop.\\n\\nI\\'ve been here only once and it\\'s beyond memorable: It was a late night saturday around 2am and my two friends and I were on a search for late night foods. Matt suggested the Sandwich Shop with a description of a \"quiet, low key, good food atmosphere\" which was much preferable of any other options at that early hour. So naturally, we are hungry after escaping the hipsters of Remedy we are down for some regular chill.\\n\\nWe seat ourselves outside to wait out some of the crowd and drink the remainder of our 6 pack of PBR cans [remember we had just come from hipster/lawrenceville] when out of nowhere our simple pleasurable time is disturbed with the outbreak of a 10 person fight! [we got lucky because this is apparently unusual] -- there was even astonishment from the participants [\"REALLY? We are having a fight at the Sandwiche Shoppe????\" - yup pronounced that way]\\n\\nAnyways, there was much scramble to break up the fight and not stub out eyes with cigarette buds and the chefs did quite a job at driving the trouble makers away. Surprisingly, no cops came checking anything out just drove along liberty ave.\\n\\nNeedless to say this delayed our now greatly awaited sandwiches which we received for free in the process. [we tipped very well that night] The guy making our food brought us our food and engaged us in a friendly chat for about 15 minutes [much needed to restore his nerves]. Also surprising, we were lucky enough not to be involved in this altercation. \\n\\nAll together this was a great late night adventure, with dinner AND a show!!! Can\\'t wait for the next visit.'],\n",

Little attention was paid to any of those things or to the atmosphere created.  The place has potential to be cute and quirky.  Instead what I remember most are the recycled store bought tubs on the shelves, such as large Parkay butter tubs - to hold the prep through the day in the refrigerator.  Meh.\\n\\nThe food was good.  I've had better.  I've had much worse.  It was clean in here, a clean grill, clean plates, and a clean work surface.  But I have had better and expect more than cleanly prepared food.\\n\\nThe price was very reasonable - inexpensive and affordable.\\n\\nI don't think I'll be back as I'd rather try some other place and take my chances than to just have okay food again here.\"],\n",

       "  u\"I stopped by yesterday for brunch with CM around 1pm.  I'd passed the Bloomfield Sandwich Shop countless times on my bike, and had often wondered about the food and the clientele.  When a friend cancelled alternate brunch plans with my on Fri., but I was still craving breakfast food, the idea occurred to me to finally check this place out.  I'm very glad that I finally did, given the sandwich shop provided me with one of the most memorable brunches I've had in PGH.\\n\\nThis place is the definition of a hole-in-the-wall--it's very small inside, so expect to get cozy with the owners and other customers during your visit.  In true diner style, CM and I opted to sit at the counter.  Indeed, space was at such a premium that at a couple points, one of the owners placed dirty plates on the counter a bit closer than I'd like for a minute or two before proceeding to clean them.  As for the decor, the best way to describe it is flower child kitsch, with a dash of sports (indeed, surprisingly, the paper placemats contained sports trivia).  You really do feel as though you're in the owners' kitchen when you're here.  CM described it as organized chaos, which I thought was quite apt.\\n\\nAs for the food, as far as I can tell, the sandwich shop offers the most inexpensive breakfast in PGH (aside from McD's, etc.)--everything on the menu is $5 or less, and the portions are generous.  Despite this, as others have mentioned, the quality of the food is quite good--on par with, if not better than, Pamela's, and leaps and bounds above EnP.  CM ordered a hobo cake, a breakfast sandwich consisting of eggs and cheese between two pancakes ($4.50), with bacon (+ $1.25), and I ordered the short stack of pancakes ($4.25) with Nutter Butter cookies and chocolate chips (+ $1.00).  Both entrees were delicious, and very satisfying, not to mention filling.  (In fact, CM fell into a carb coma shortly after going back to his place.)\\n\\nAlthough the food and prices are great, what really makes eating at the sandwich shop a real experience is the owners, Mike and Mama Ros.  Mike, who waited on us, has a great sense of humor, joking with us and making us feel like family from the time we walked in the door to the time we left--and even afterward (he greeted us again when he and Mama Ros were taking a break at the outside tables as we walked past on our way back to the car after taking a short walk).  From talking to him, we learned that he and Mama Ros have run the sandwich shop for 15 years (impressive!), and that he lived in San Jose, CA prior to moving to PGH.  We didn't get to talk to Mama Ros much, because she was working the grill at the time we were there and it was quite busy, but they both seem like great people.\\n\\nNeedless to say, we had an awesome first experience at the Bloomfield Sandwich Shop, and look forward to returning for more.  While I'm tempted to award 5 stars, there were a few minor shortcomings on the food front (use of boxed pancake mix, lack of maple syrup), and the chaotic atmosphere may not be for everyone.  Having said that, if you're looking for cheap and plentiful portions of basic diner fare done well served up by friendly owners, check out this neighborhood institution--it won't let you down!  4.5 stars.\"],\n",

So freakin good!!! \\nMy only \"issue\" is that they never seem to add enough sauce on your pasta, but you can ask for some extra on the side and they bring you a little bowlful. It\\'s perfect!!!\\nI get hot sausage on top (which isn\\'t too spicy) and broccoli (which is always steamed just right, so it\\'s not limp). \\nThe bread always comes with olive oil and parmesean cheese that you can dip it in.

       "  u\"Living in Bloomfield, I was excited to finally try some authentic, excellent Italian fare. Unfortunately, I hadn't had much luck so far at Pleasure Bar (okay food), or D'Amico's (awful food). I've had more consistent, tasty Italian at the Olive Garden, which is sad. So I decided to give Alexander's Italian Bistro a try.\\n\\nWe stopped in tonight, a Saturday evening. The place was pretty much full and we didn't have a reservation, but we got seated after just a few minutes. The tables are packed pretty tight and you can see the servers dancing around each other precariously. The decor is charming without being all tacky like other local Italian places...I love the beautiful backlit stained glass panels that open the space up. There is a nice little bar area in the front with a smaller bar food menu and a couple nice TVs...we'll have to check that out soon.\\n\\nMr. got the Eggplant Alexander, I got the Mafalda Alexander. The eggplant was nice and crispy, not mushy inside like eggplant parmesan can often turn out. It was very rich and definitely two meals worth of food. My pasta was excellent. The noodles were flavorful on their own, and cooked freshly and perfectly. I like the mafalda noodles, which aren't too commonly used in most Italian places. The sauce, a mixture of marinara and alfredo, was tasty and not overpowering. The spicy Italian sausage was soooo good...just the right amount of spicy, tender and flavorful. They give a pretty large basket of bread that is moist, fresh, and flaky.\\n\\nWe got the tiramisu for dessert, which was pretty good. It's hard to find real tiramisu anyways so I give them credit for having it. The ladyfingers were a little bit tough to cut with a spoon but they were good, and the cream was very good, not too sweet. A nice finish to the meal.\\n\\nOnly downsides...no soup or salad included with the dish, those are extra. Our server was nice enough but kinda disappeared when we were finished with our food...we waited around a good 15 minutes for her to come back and wrap Mr.'s leftovers and ask if we wanted dessert, then another 10 minutes after finishing dessert for her to come back with the check. This is one of my top pet peeves.\\n\\nAlexander himself (I'm pretty sure anyway...) stopped by the table at the end of our meal to ask how everything was, which is always a nice touch in my book. Everyone working there seemed like they must be family, but not the type of family who dread working for the family business, which is nice.\\n\\nWe'll definitely be back.\"],\n",

They give you an un-eatably huge portion which is fine by me, it makes a great lunch the next day. Also, I think the decor and prices make this a great spot for a date night.

       "  u'I\\'m sorry, this place is simply not good. Unfortunately, it is yet another example of poorly made Americanized Italian food. Too much cheese, too much butter and cream, and quite possibly the worst bread I have ever consumed at any Italian restaurant in my life. \\n\\nSomeone had to go out of their way to find bread this flavorless and awful. It\\'s already a travesty that it\\'s served to me before the meal, but to put it on my sandwich! I\\'m actually offended for Italians, and bread. Yes bread, this is not your best. The eggplant Parmesan served to my mother was soggy, covered with an absurd amount of plastic Parmesan cheese swimming in a bland sauce. My fathers pasta, cream and cheese. Contrary to popular believe, this is not traditional Italian! This is what some would refer to as, terrible and heavy. And the cannoli? Words could not describe my disappointment.\\n\\nI\\'ll admit it, I\\'m already an Italian food snob. I cook tons of Italian food for myself, family, and friends, and I only use the highest quality ingredients and go about preparing my meals in traditional southern Italian ways. I\\'ve had phenomenal Italian meals at the few great Italian restaurants in this city, so whenever I get the opportunity to eat at another \"Italian\" joint, I\\'m heading in with high expectations.\\n\\nIs this what Italian food in Pittsburgh has come too? Seeing other similar Italian places in Bloomfield, I\\'m sad to say...yes. I\\'m actually slightly upset even writing this because the waitstaff is charming, and I hear the owners are great, but to pass this off as representative of Italian food is an injustice.

I'm not a huge fan of wedding soup, but Alexander's has one of the best.The mac n' cheese is fabulous as well. Everything here is. Nothing is done cheap. The atmosphere is dimly lit and romantic, I suppose, the bartenders are sweet and conversational, and the servers are timely, polite and very friendly.

I didn\\'t have high expectations - I thought I would get standard Italian fare with nothing special while also probably paying too much.  From the get go I was wrong!\\n\\nThe decor and ambiance isn\\'t upscale but it also isn\\'t terrible.  It feels like a down home, mom and pop type of restaurant.  It sort of reminded me of a place that Tony and his crew would eat at in \"The Sopranos\" - good food and cool ownership.  When we entered, it looked like the owner was chatting it up with some regulars.  Seeing us, he warmly greeted us and introduced us to our waitress.  Before I get to the food a note on the service.  Our waitress was great - super friendly, helping us with any questions, and checking up on us during our meal just enough to feel taken care of but not intrusive by any means.  I could tell this wasn\\'t her first rodeo.\\n\\nThe food was spot on.  Along with our menus, we got a basket full of fresh Italian bread and butter.  The bread was standard white but it was moist and tasted very fresh.  But you know how it is - don\\'t fill up on bread!  Perusing the menu, they had a lot of variation which I love - chicken marsala, spaghetti, etc but the chicken parmigiana sandwich was calling my name.  It came on hearty bread strong enough to hold the sandwich and not fall apart.  The best part was the chicken which was crispy!  It came with what tasted like homemade sauce and cheese.  It\\'s a simple meal but very tasty - you bite into it and first get the slightly sweet sauce and cheese then the hearty chicken.  Mmmm.\\n\\nThe sandwich was around $9 and it came with fries.  A very good and hearty meal.  I look forward to trying some of the other options at Alexanders the next time around!'],\n",

I choose the Bolognese with penne  (~$12) and mushrooms (extra $1.50), while my husband ordered the Marfredo with farfelle ($11), sundried tomatoes and hot sausage (extra $4). Bolognese was solid though lacked mushrooms and my husband's dish was tasty too though the hot sausage was bland, it needed salt. Portions are huge, mine was easily two meals. Italian bread or rolls (not warmed up) w/ butter balls comes with the meal and there is EVOO on the table. For dessert, we ordered the chocolate chip cannolli which came with two - we enjoyed them but it pricey for the size $7. Aside from the dessert, the meal was reasonably priced.\\n\\nService was consistent with other Yelpers' reviews - really, really friendly. We liked our waitress. Because there were no mushrooms in my dish, she was suppose to take it off our bill but forgot so ended up giving a cash credit. Also I ended up packaging my Bolognese home since I couldn't eat it all and she asked if we wanted the rolls too and wrapped my pasta in saran wrap for the trip home to prevent any sauce spillage which was a smart move since we had walked here.\\n\\nOne comment though would be on the decor. You walk in and the bar area somewhat has a modern feel but then once you go into the dining room it is like you are warped back into time. There is just a lot of visual stimulation - over the top - that just doesn't go together.\\n\\nOverall though, Alexander's just gets it done - nothing fancy w/ home style food and  great prices and service. We'll be skipping other Italian places in the area and will be back again.\"],\n",

       "  u\"Loved it! \\n\\nI was not too excited about trying to eat healthy at an Italian joint, but went with friends. I was impressed at how many healthier options they had, if that's what you're in the mood for. Or pig out on a hot plate of carbs and dairy with a side of italian sausage.\\n\\nMy friends and I split an order of beans, greens and tomatoes. I regret the sharing part, it was so outrageously delicious I wanted it all to myself. Next time I'm getting my own.\\n\\nIn the spirit of healthy eating, I went with a salad, which was big, fresh, and just what I wanted. If you like salad, you're set. If not, the pasta my friends had looked great too. You can get gluten free or whole wheat pasta for an additional charge if you like. My boy friend had angel hair with alfredo, our friend had linguini marinara with fried calamari.\\n\\nThe waitress was very pleasant, and kept her cool even though she had the pleasure of serving this merry band of drunk, vicious old queens.\\n\\nNow I would have been sold on the service and the food, everything I tasted was great. But the two pasta dishes weren't all that hot. Somewhat warmer than warm, they said. My friend let the waitress know but wasn't unhappy enough to send it back, even though the manager was adamant they could remake  the plate in no time. (I work in a customer based industry and I know first hand, nothing can be worse than an unhappy customer who isn't willing to let you fix the problem after they bring it to your attention.) So at the end of the meal, he offered to buy us a round of drinks instead. Smart guy - offer a couple of drunks some free liquor, and all is forgiven. He took an almost great meal and made it great for them. Sadly, I was driving so didn't take him up on the offer. \\n\\nSo - great food, beans and greens, lots of choices, beans and greens, good service, and beans and greens. If it were closer to home I'd be ready to move in.\"],\n",

       "  u\"I've lived in the area for over three years and I must have passed this place hundreds of times but last week was the first time I dined here.  I totally regret having passed this place up!\\n\\nThe problem is, this place is across from Silky's which I know and love, and based on the exterior I assumed this was a very expensive restaurant geared towards the 50+ crowd.  \\n\\nIt *is* nice inside, but when we dined here I was in sweat pants and not an eyebrow was raised.  Full disclosure:  I was dying at the end of a long urban hike, and we were right next to Alexander's and I told my friend I would hate him forever if he did not buy me pasta RIGHT.NOW.  :)  \\n\\nAlexander's totally hit the spot.  It was so good!  I was really surprised!  I had the chicken bruschetta and it was DELCIOUS.  I'd had the same item at Del's a few weeks ago and Del's cannot hold a candle to Alexanders.  My chicken breast was only slightly seasoned which is a sign of a good, confident chef.  The chicken was delicious and perfect and came out tasting like well seasoned chicken, not salt.\\n\\nIt came with a side of pasta in any sauce I wanted from their lengthy list of sauces.  I chose penne in gorgonzola cream sauce.  The gorgonzola sauce was extremely strong.  VERY cheesy.  I like gorgonzola, but it was a bit strong for me--although it was still very good.\\n\\nMy friend had a spaghetti and marinara in the marinara was incredible.  You can tell its made on site.  It was excellent.  \\n\\nOur entrees came with side salads which were very good, and there was bread nad oil on the table for dipping although we didn't get into that too much.  I will def be back, and if you havent tried alexander's, I recommend it.\\n\\nIts good, and you're not going to go broke eating here.\"],\n",

       "  u\"Alexander's is good, solid Italian food without any pretentiousness. Their menu is large, but not outrageously expansive like a lot of other local Italian restaurants in the area. There's a nice selection of Italian favorites, plus you have the ability to create your own past dish (choose your pasta, type of sauce, and add-ons).\\n\\nI've been to Alexander's several times for lunch and always enjoyed it, so I decided to take my girlfriend there for dinner on a recent night. When we entered, we were warmly greeted by the staff and asked where we wanted to sit. We sat in the front of the house/bar area so I could keep an eye on the Pirates game. While there, I overheard an older lady complaining that her dish was less than stellar. The server and the manager agreed with her assessment and offered to make her anything else on the menu to make her happy. I've always been pleased by the pleasant, accommodating nature of the staff when I've visited Alexander's; it's truly a strong point of the restaurant.\\n\\nI ordered the pork osso bucco with garlic risotto, while my girlfriend went with chicken parmigiano. We opened with bruschetta toast. It was a nice start. The tomatoes were fresh, and the taste of balsamic vinegar gave it a little pop of flavor. I then had their wedding soup, which is always enjoyable. It's full of meat and has just the right level of saltiness to it. My girlfriend was pleased with her garden salad; in particular, she enjoyed the flavor and texture added by walnuts and cranberries.\\n\\nThe pork osso bucco I received was huge. Unfortunately, the flavor was not as big as the size of the dish. The pork was tender and properly cooked... the garlic risotto, not so much. It was just kind of bland. Together, the dish was fairly tasty, but not something that I would order again. My girlfriend was pleased with her massive serving of chicken parmigiano and pasta. It was good, but the breading was a little soggy because it was doused in sauce.\\n\\nSomewhere during the course of our dinner, the manager walked from table to table, and asked every group if they wanted a loaf of Italian bread. I suppose that they had a lot of extra bread and were giving it out since the night was winding down. I heartily accepted- their bread is delicious. Little things like this are why I love Alexander's.\\n\\nIf you're looking for some tasty Italian food served in a friendly, welcoming atmosphere, you can't go wrong with Alexander's. Just stick with the pasta, and you'll be happy.\"],\n",

And it was take-out, too, so there wasn't much I could do about it after driving all the way home.

       "  u\"I have been coming to Alexander's  off and on for almost 25 years. I think in all that time I have only had one meal that was below par. Pretty good average I'd say. I went the other night with my adult daughter. I had the calamari with pasta, a cocktail ( yum, yum), and a garden salad. The salad was very fresh and arrived promptly. The cocktail was strong but great. The calamari arrived quickly and was piled so high on the plate I could barely see over the plate! It was served on what tasted like fresh tomatoes over the pasta. It was so good I couldn't stop eating it, even after I was full. \\n\\nMy daughter had the salad too with linguini and clam sauce. It was loaded with clams. They were tasty and not rubbery. She suspected they were canned but since they were tender it was okay. The sauce was fragrant too, not fishy. \\n\\nOur server was super efficient and polite. She kept up with us without being intrusive. The decor of the restaurant has been updated a bit over time. It's cute. A bit too bright for an Italian restaurant if you ask me, but I'm from New England where Italian places are all dimly lit. \\n\\nOverall, a wonderful, easy going, friendly  neighborhood place to go to relax over some good food and drink. Have a few laughs without a tv interrupting your dinner conversation. You have to sit in the bar for that. Take your mom. Take the family. Take your husband when you can't stand another night of cooking. Just go it alone and who cares about anyone else?! Just have fun eating some really good food that tastes like someone cares.\"],\n",

       "  u'I AM BOYCOTTING ALEXANDER\\'S FOR LIFE!!! The manager SCREAMED AT ME at the top of his lungs in an epic meltdown that lasted 10 minutes! \\n\\nOn Sat., April 12, 2014, I attended the 50th birthday party for my dear friend, David Flynn. I organized the party, but relied on Dave and his sister to provide me with the final head count. I made the reservation for 25 people.\\n\\nThe manager and I played phone tag for the two days before the event. I called back and left messages TWICE to confirm, but apparently he never got my messages. (This was part of his rant, his indignation at unreturned phone calls that actually HAD been returned!)\\n\\nThe dinner started at 7 PM. Most of our group arrived on time, but some of our group (including me) arrived between 8 PM-9 PM. I was working on a homemade birthday present for Dave, which took longer than expected. I called Dave, his sister and my friends (Reesa & Joel) to tell them I was running late. In hindsight, I should have also called the restaurant to let them know, and for that I am truly sorry. That still doesn\\'t justify the manager SCREAMING AT ME FOR 10 MINUTES!\\n\\nAfter enjoying a delicious dinner, drinks and birthday cake, none of us had a clue that anything was wrong. If the decision to return to a restaurant were based SOLELY on the food and wait staff, I would definitely return to Alexander\\'s. But sadly, when the manager has a nuclear meltdown and throws a 10-MINUTE SCREAMING TEMPER TANTRUM, it tends to sour one on returning to a restaurant.\\n\\nTowards the end of our dinner, some of us started to smell cigarette smoke, which we later realized was coming from the patio out front. (It was a warm night, and they had the front sliding-glass doors open.) In the midst of the smoke discussion, the manager approached our table and began an EPIC RANT, SCREAMING AT ME FOR 10 MINUTES!!!\\n\\nHe was angry that everyone in our group hadn\\'t arrived at exactly 7 PM. The restaurant\\'s kitchen is open till 10 PM on Sat. night, so I don\\'t understand why this was a big deal. We ended up with 20 people total and 5 no-shows. I am always disappointed by no-shows, but I explained this possibility to the manager when I made the reservation. I STILL BROUGHT HIM 20 PAYING CUSTOMERS! \\n\\nBTW...the dining room was practically EMPTY, which is not what I would expect on a Saturday night in Pittsburgh. Maybe I\\'m not the first customer to be on the receiving end of the manager\\'s meltdown.\\n\\nThe manager SCREAMED that he had called me twice, and I hadn\\'t called him back! He ranted about this about a dozen times. I told him I HAD called him back - TWICE. It\\'s not my fault if he didn\\'t get my messages. \\n\\nHe SCREAMED that he had put an extra waitress and cook on staff because he expected 25 people. He SCREAMED that I had cost the restaurant $100! How much money do you think 20 people spent on appetizers, dinner and drinks? I find it hard to believe that they didn\\'t make any money, or at least break even. \\n\\nI am sorry that there were 5 no-shows in our group, but I always thought Saturday night was the busiest night of the week for most restaurants. I didn\\'t realize the restaurant would look like a deserted, old western ghost town with hardly any customers. On a Saturday night, I assumed they would have a full staff on duty with or without my reservation. I was wrong. I\\'m sorry. I\\'m not perfect.\\n\\nThe manager also YELLED at me and my friends for \"LOOKING COMFORTABLE\" in his restaurant!!! Since when is looking comfortable an OFFENSE??? I thought restaurants wanted you to feel comfortable, but apparently not at Alexander\\'s.\\n\\nHe also SCREAMED that one of the waitresses only got a $1.00 tip! I found that hard to believe, but just in case he wasn\\'t making it up, I tipped my waitress $35 on my $26 dinner check! I am a former waitress, and I would feel HORRIBLE if any waitress every got ripped off on my watch! Even if his story wasn\\'t true, I figured she deserved an extra big tip just for having to WORK in such a horrible place where the manager YELLS at paying customers!!! If he treats the customers this way, I can only imagine how he treats the employees. \\n\\nTHE MANAGER\\'S RUDE BEHAVIOR HAS COST HIM MY BUSINESS AND MY FRIENDS\\' BUSINESS FOREVER!!! During his rant, he actually SCREAMED that he never wanted to see me in his restaurant ever again! I\\'m happy to grant him that wish. And so are my friends. \\n\\nThis is an example of the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I have ever witnessed in my entire life!!! I thought the manager was going to have a heart attack or a stroke the way he was SCREAMING FOR 10 MINUTES!\\n\\nSCREAMING at paying customers is completely unacceptable behavior, and I will NEVER eat at Alexander\\'s ever again. It\\'s really a shame because I loved their salmon with pesto sauce. But great food can\\'t make up for a manager who throws a TEMPER TANTRUM and SCREAMS AT YOU. Also, you can smell smoke in the dining room, which sucks. My friends and I are BOYCOTTING ALEXANDER\\'S FOR LIFE!!!'],\n",

       "  u'My husband and I had one of our first dates in Pittsburgh at Alexander\\'s, so it has a special place in my heart.  I knew he was a keeper when we ordered the asparagus/goat cheese appetizer and I loved it so much that he let me eat all but one piece on my own.  \\n\\nThere is a bar areas out front that has a more casual feel and dining room in the back.  The dining room is small and intimate offering several booths along the sides of the restaurant and several tables in the middle and towards the front of the dining room.  The decor has a homey feel with nice colors and a fun chandelier.\\n\\nThe menu is much more extensive then a typical Italian restaurant.  There are several appetizer choices in addition to the previously mentioned grilled asparagus.  There are also several salads and two soup options, the soup of the day and wedding soup.  \\n\\nThe first time I was there I tried the veal diablo which was veal with hot peppers and mushrooms and a Marsala sauce.  It was delicious.  It had a nice kick but wasn\\'t too hot that you didn\\'t enjoy it.  On my second visit I enjoyed the \"pastabilities\" create your own pasta.  With 10+ sauce choices plus 10+ pasta the combinations seem endless!  I enjoyed the angel hair with the Marsala wine and red pepper sauce.  My husband had the Bolognese and was equally happy.  The pasta seemed to be in an endless bowl.  I felt like I was eating forever and there was still two meals worth of pasta left in my take out container.  The build your own pasta is quite a value for the price (although it does not come with a soup or salad like the other entrees do).  \\n\\nWe were stuffed, but after seeing several desserts go by, I decided I wanted to order the Napoleon.  It was stuffed with strawberries and blueberries and the cream was delectable.  \\n\\nOverall a great dining experience.  We will be back.'],\n",

The dining room is small and decorated to look like an Italian trattoria. The menu has all the basics, tons of pastas, different sauces, meatballs, parmigiana, etc. The bread is from (I'm pretty sure) Mancini's which is an old Italian-American bakery in the city. Come as you are: jeans, Steelers jersey, college sweatshirt, what have you. The service can be a bit flaky, but everyone is quite nice. Just relax. If they mix up an order they'll make it right. I love the wedding soup here and they make awesome chicken piccatta. I also like how they serve the meat and pasta dishes separately on small plates, instead of dumping everything together on a big dinner plate. For dessert they make a real tiramisu with lots of rum, and also really good rice pudding. One warning: it is really easy to overeat here.

       "  u'Alexander\\'s offers some of the worst Italian food I\\'ve ever had. I went there with my girlfriend and my parents on a Saturday night, and from start to finish the experience that Alexander\\'s gave us was simply awful. First, when we arrived around 6 pm, the restaurant was half-empty (bad sign #1). The hostess seated us at a table in the center of the very cramped and very small dining room (bad sign #2). Then, our waitress did not even come over to take drink orders for another 10 minutes (bad sign #3).\\n\\nOnce the waitress finally arrived and took our orders, the food itself offered no relief. My girlfriend and I ordered the Caesar salad - the salads were drowning in Caesar dressing, the croutons were badly burnt and inedible, and there were too many croutons to begin with. This restaurant couldn\\'t even get a simple salad right, but I hoped against hope that the entrees would be an improvement.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the entrees were no better. My girlfriend ordered Chicken Alfredo. Not only was the dish absurdly light on chicken (3 small pieces total? Come on!), the alfredo sauce was thick and gummy to the point of tasting like glue. My mom ordered the Mushroom ravioli, which was completely bland. I ordered the Veal Diablo with Shrimp; the plate came with 3 pieces of veal sliced extremely thin, 3 nice sized shrimp, and... that was it. No pasta, no garlic bread, nothing but an ocean of very mediocre marinara sauce. I finished my entire plate, the remaining half of my mom\\'s plate after she was finished eating, and as much as I could stomach of my girlfriend\\'s Alfredo (which was only a couple of forkfuls, as that Alfredo sauce was one of the foulest things I\\'ve ever eaten), but I still was left hungry.\\n\\nThe dessert course offered a distinctly rotten cherry on top of this already heaping garbage sundae. We were initially assured that all of the desserts were made in-house, but that soon proved not to be the case. Indeed, for several of our desserts, a store-bought version would have been an improvement. I ordered a cannoli, figuring that even a crappy Italian restaurant can\\'t screw up a cannoli, as it is a violation of Italian Law or something. Unfortunately, their \"fresh-made\" cannolis consisted of a pre-packaged cannoli shell, pre-packaged cannoli filling (which, by the way, was gritty, as though someone had dumped in white sugar but not mixed the cream thoroughly enough for the sugar to dissolve), and put the two together in the kitchen. Needless to say, my cannoli was awful. My girlfriend ordered the tiramisu, and what she received was about as far removed from tiramisu as one can get. There were almost no ladyfingers, and the ones that were in the dish were drowning in coffee. On top of that, the dessert was swamped with an excessive amount of coffee-flavored cream that essentially destroyed the dish. My uncle\\'s chocolate cake was dry and uninspiring; a store-bought cake would have been more moist.\\n\\nI did not pick up the check - my uncle was nice enough to do that - so I did not see the final bill. However, they could not have paid me to eat this often-inedible food. The service was slow and inattentive, the food was simply awful, and I left hungry. Do not waste your time, your money, or your energy with this place, as you can get better Italian food virtually anywhere else in the city.'],\n",

The grilled asparagus is also quite impressive given how simple it is, but I'd agree with Pepin in saying that the best food is ordinary things prepared extraordinarily well.

Pasta dishes were an average of $15 and didn't even come w/ a house salad.  They did come w/ soup? however, we were not offered any and forgot about it until this morning.  All of the pasta dishes my party ordered as well as the  entr\\xe9e salads were mediocre (chicken looked like it was processed?) and didn't have many of the ingredients that were outlined on the menu.

The only drawback of this was that we couldn\\'t help but overhear the conversations at neighboring tables.  \\n\\nI liked the menu, they had many classic dishes and also a make-to-order pasta section.  My parents have simple tastes, so this suited us very well.  All choices were reasonably priced.  I ordered penne pasta with \"marfredo\" sauce- a blend of marinara and alfredo.

Let me start with a little story.  My sister lived in Northern California and was visiting.  We were talking about places to eat and I of course mentioned and suggested Thai Cuisine, knowing how good their food is.  My sister was skeptical, to say the least, mentioning in the same breath that she lives in the San Francisco area, could a place in Pittsburgh actually be that good if not better than restaurants in CA?  I decided to let the food speak for itself  --- and it did!  My sister ordered the red curry (duck with pineapple), her fave dish, and she LOVED it.  In fact, she admitted after that this restaurant was indeed the best she had had - and that it was too bad that it was in Pittsburgh.  \\n\\nMe personally?  I love the green curry with mock duck (wheat gluten) - and I am not vegan or vegetarian.  I would like to mention that this restaurant has a nice selection of vegetarian and vegan options.  The crispy spring rolls are yummy, especially with the sauce.  The soups are all pretty great.  \\n\\nYou should try this restaurant, it will definitely be worth your time.  And if you like your food spicy, like I do, make sure you tell them you want it thai spicey at 10 out of 10!  :)'],\n",

Their menu strikes a great vegetable/protein balance for non-meat eaters, and it looks like it does the same for omnivores.\\n\\nThe price is great too, you can get plenty of food for about $10 per person (not including tip or drinks)\"],\n",

I had to wait 15 minutes for a table.  I always feel waiting for a table is more of a positive than a negative as it usually means good things are to come.  I started out with the special shrimp fried in wontons.  It was unmemorable and I would of like to have seen bigger shrimp for this 6.95 appetizer.  I ordered the vegetable tom yum soup.  This was outstanding.  The vegetables were large and fresh and the spice was perfect.  I asked for medium and actually got medium.  I went with the standard pineapple curry as i always do the first time at a thai place.  Every bite was enjoyable and again the medium spice was perfect.

Seriously seriously good (I had it with duck) and you can definitely split it. Also, this place is cheap...you really can't do better than their lunch deal. I wish I had a place like Thai Cuisine nearby in DC.\\n\\nOnly thing I've had here that I didn't like: the fresh rolls are kind of mediocre but I'm not much of a fan of fresh rolls to begin with so take that as you will.\"],\n",

       "  u'If I could give more than 5 stars, I would!\\n\\nNow, I will be a tad sentimental here.  Thai Cuisine was my first experience with Thai.  A friend brought me there for lunch back in 2006 - and I have been a junkie ever since.  And, to be perfectly honest, I have only found one other place in the burgh that I think has comparable food in terms of taste - and the prices there are much higher.  We live about 45 minute drive from TC so for us to frequent there means that we really do enjoy the food!\\n\\nOver the years, DH and I have brought many friends to TC.  To be honest, it is not much to look at.  It really is lacking in atmosphere and, to be honest, I would love to see them clean up their restrooms a lot.  But the service is always good and the food - well, the food is so good, I can live with this little \"diner\".  Besides, we always end up down the street afterwards for a coffee and there are restrooms there :)\\n\\nWe have tried all of the appetizers - DH says it is hands down the best hot & sour he has ever had.  Steamed dumplings are the tastiest in town - good taste but nothing overwhelming (i have had them with so much garlic, I regret eating them). Spring rolls are always tasty & fresh.  BTW - if you go at lunch, they add a tiny salad with peanut dressing to your plate - try not to lick the plate when you are done :)\\n\\nI think we have tried every curry on the menu - red, green, pineapple, panang, musman, winter.  Winter is always our favorite - a green curry with the pumpkin is to die for.  DH will scrape the bowl on this one. \\n\\nI am a noodle junkie.  My favorite here of all the dishes is their Pad See Ew.  I always get it with shrimp which are nice-sized and plentiful.  It is the sauce that differentiates this from other Thai places.  TC uses a sweet black bean sauce that is amazing.  I have tried this dish and it is the sauce that makes this dish.  I have liked their Rad Na and enjoyed the fried rices but I always come back to the Pad See Ew because I know that I can\\'t find comparable anywhere else.\\n\\nI will admit that we have never tried desserts there. To be honest, we find the portions plentiful and have never wanted dessert afterwards.\\n\\nIf you are looking for atmosphere, head to Squirrel Hill or the South Side or Wexford. If you are looking for tasty food at a reasonable price, this is your spot.  And just remember - there is always takeout!'],\n",

The tables and seating look much nicer than the price, which was under $10 for me I believe for just a curry/meat/rice bowl, which was more than filling. My dad ordered the same thing and asked for \"9\" spiciness, but did not think it was spicy at all. I asked for \"5\" not really sure what the scale meant and it did not taste remotely spicy (which was fine).\\n\\nWe\\'ve gone a second time and both got the same thing as the first.

I ordered the hot and sour soup which I gobbled up right away. It was delicious and super hot, just how I like it. I ordered one of the Pad Thai's I don't quite recall which one exactly but I thought it was very yummy. I enjoyed the fact that they give you a scale of spiciness from 1-10 to choose from. Usually at restaurants people just ask if you want it mild or spicy, but this gives people a nice range to choose from. My friend got one of the curry dishes they had and it was really good as well. After a night of searching for food, I'm glad I ended up with a satisfying meal.\"],\n",

I've not had a bad meal here, and everything I've tried has been delicious, with the green curry standing out in my mind as one of the best I've had anywhere. We came here with a large group of people one night, some of whom had never had Thai food, and all left happy and appreciative of my excellent taste when it comes to choosing restaurants. (pat, pat, pat). One of my friends had the springroll and liked it so much he ordered another for dinner. Service here is always good, with a friendly and professional staff that takes the time to help you with ordering. The one downside is that parking is a challenge, as this is a busy street in a bustling neighborhood. I usually find parking on a sidestreet, and would brave much more difficult hurdles to get to this food.\"],\n",

       "  u\"We stopped back in here on a hot Friday night for our second visit to the place, and it was just as amazing as the first, several years ago.\\n\\nI like the fact that the name of this restaurant is just what they offer: Thai Cuisine.  Nothing fancy, nothing they can charge you an arm and a leg for because it's gourmet or anything like that.  It's just good, delicious, well-prepared Thai food, served by a knowledgable and friendly waitstaff.\\n\\nLast night, we were starving after walking around in the 90+ degree heat for several hours, so we ordered a few plates of appetizers to split before our entrees.  They have a page of 'daily specials' with their menu, and 'shrimp blankets' were on it, so we checked them out.  Basically, it's a shrimp (tail-on) in a spring roll, served with a dipping sauce.  So very good.\\n\\nWe also got an order of the spring rolls, which were ever-so-slightly tangy, and the Thai toast, which was so crispy and delicious, I considered getting a second order.  Their cucumber dipping sauce comes with little chunks of fresh cucumber in it.  \\n\\nAnd since I recently discovered the magic of veggie tom-yum soup, I decided to try theirs.  Oh, so good!  On a hot day, I always crave something salty, and this was exactly what I wanted: the bowl is crammed with veggies and tofu (salty, spicy tofu - yum!), and the broth is just spicy enough to please your tastebuds but not overwhelm them.\\n\\nThe servers will ask how spicy you would like to have your meal prepared (the soup as well).  I tried everything at a 4, which I felt was just fine.  It wasn't bland, but I wasn't panting.  Our server said that around a 7 is when things start to get seriously spicy, so go ahead and order in that range if you are brave!\\n\\nI had the garlic pepper pork (my favorite Thai meal) for an entree.  It was incredible, salty and garlicky and the white rice was puffy and just the tiniest bit sticky in that perfectly-prepared way.  Lots of good chunks of veggies on the plate as well, and enough sauce to spread on your rice (and enough food to have leftovers for lunch the next day!).  My husband got the pork fried rice, and it was a huge, tasty portion.  Thankfully, the servers were quick with water refills, because all that saltiness makes you thirsty!\\n\\nAnother perk - Thai Cuisine is BYOB!  I truly wish we'd planned on our visit last night, so we could have brought a bottle of wine with us (the closest liquor store is down on Butler Street, so a bit of a hike if you're walking), but we just happened to be in the area when my Thai food craving hit.  I am so glad Thai Cuisine was there to supply the delicious food that I needed!\"],\n",

       "  u\"This is my local Thai food place. It's not necessarily my favorite, or the best around but here's why I like it:\\n\\n-It's good. I've liked everything I've ordered.\\n-It's dependable. Things are consistently good, and I order here fairly often.\\n-They usually get the spice right (of what you ask for on a scale of 1-10)\\n- It's better than the other one that is a block away. I don't know what other people have to say about this because I hear conflicting opinions of Thai Cuisine and Thai Gourmet, but I have tried them both and can say that I just like this one more. \\n\\nMy favorite dish is the green curry. Most veg packed and the tofu option is a great combination (I'm not a veg, but I eat veg often). I really like the way their tofu is steamed, its creamy and delicious in the thin curry sauce. I usually prefer a thicker curry but something about this curry really works as a thin texture - pretty soupy. But it's light and delicious and I am usually drinking it out of the bottom of my bowl like soup. \\n\\nI get take-out here quite often, and it is always ready fairly quickly, but I really wish they would deliver so I would not have to move my lazy, hungover ass out of my house. \\n\\nThe dining experience is OK. BYOB is a great plus, but the interior leaves a lot to be desired. The service is always great. Friendly and accommodating and the manager is always there to greet with a smile.\"],\n",

The name says it all--straight-up, no frills Thai. They aren't trying to do anything creative or fusiony, they just make good food. First things first, I'm obsessed with fresh spring rolls so for a restaurant to become my primary Thai destination, it has to get those right. Thai Cuisine's are not the best I've ever had, but they are definitely up there as one of my favorites in Pittsburgh. Soft, fresh, and big...nothing's worse than a puny spring roll that is practically frozen from sitting in a refrigerator all day (ahem...Thai Place). So since Thai Cuisine passes the spring roll test, I can talk about their other food, which is all delicious. My favorite is the Pineapple Curry, but I've liked everything I've tried here. If you're one of those people who doesn't venture past Pad Thai, don't worry, that's good too. As a bonus, the portions here are pretty large so the prices are pretty reasonable for the amount of food you get.\\n\\nThe most reliable Thai place I've found so far in the city (although I haven't tried them all yet).\"],\n",

I ordered Threes Company: shrimp, scallops and calamari in a Thai chili sauce. The sauce is my favorite part of a Thai meal but Thai Cuisine came up short here. What I enjoy must about a Thai chili sauce is the complexity of flavors but this sauce in my dish was your standard thin runny brown sauce.  The kind that comes with lets say beef and broccoli.  I think the menu description was misleading and had I known it would be brown sauce I would have ordered something else.  \\n\\nSome of the onions in my dish were cold which leads me to believe that the food was not cooked to order or at least not all of it.  There was plenty of shrimp in the dish and the calamari tasted great, but the dish lacked flavor.

We had our waters filled every time we took a sip.  Our meals came quickly, almost too quick, making us think too much prep work is done.  The food was really good though.  We each got a bowl of soup.  The wife got the Tom Yum with Shrimp.  It was hot and sour in a good way.  There were three nice sized shrimp in the broth and tasted fresh.  I got the Tom Kha with shrimp, which was excellent.  The coconut broth was smooth and delicious.  I always enjoy this dish and make sure I try it everywhere.  Thai Cuisine balanced this soup very well.  We then shared a massive plate of Pad Thai with veggies and tofu.  The pad thai was good, but not great.  The portion was huge, definitely shareable especially after eating a bowl of soup.  I wasn't impressed however with the amount of veggies in the dish or the amount of sauce.  It lacked both and might get to great with a bit more of each.  Also, the veggies seemed wilted and not really fresh.  \\n\\nSo, in short.

The staff are friendly and incredibly attentive; I don't think I've ever had a glass of water that was less than three-quarters full. The food arrives at your table less than 10 minutes after the waiter takes your order. Their spice levels are pretty on point and range from 1-10, but you can always ask for the spice rack if you need an extra kick. I've tried almost all their noodle dishes and a handful of the curries and nothing has disappointed. They make one of the best Pad Thais I've ever eaten. They also have specials that are ever rotating, which makes it nice if you're looking to try something new. In general, everything is flavorful and you get what you order. Portions are sufficient for a solid meal and very reasonably priced.\\n\\nI might venture and say that this is one of the best Thai places in Pittsburgh, but I know that's highly debated here.

Another dish, red curry with chicken, was always lacking chicken pieces, they've increased prices and cut back on portions and quality, which happens quite often to good restaurants gone bad.

Every restaurant in the city that has a \"Vegetarian Option\" on the menu needs to go here and try this dish.  It is so good, with each ingredient having its own place in the dish.  Not just a mash of veggies in a thick green curry.  Truly one of the best curries I\\'ve ever had.  It makes a dish that has become boring in most other places truly exciting.  We had it again the second time and it was exceptional again.\\n\\nOur second dish was a whole spicy fish, which was also very good, and a nice compliment to the curry.  First time, at lunch, I think I had a shrimp prik pow, and that was also very nice.\\n\\nThe Ginger Tea is also great.  \\n\\nAs we were finishing dinner last time, I commented that the curry is so good that next time we\\'d have to try the Pad Thai.  That\\'s a dish we hardly ever get when its just the two of us, because it can be a bit generic, a safe choice for those that don\\'t know or really like Thai food.  But it IS the national dish of a truly world-class cuisine, and given what they do with the green curry, we thought, \"I bet it\\'s really something special\"\\n\\nAs we were leaving, the owner thanked us for coming, and as we discussed the meal a bit she said \"Oh, you have to try the Pad Thai!

I've walked by this place so many times, and I'm glad I finally made plans to eat here. \\n\\nWhen it comes to Thai food, I'm a bit of a broken record. I love Pad Sew and Pad Thai dishes, and typically insist the table gets at least one. Our table ordered the Pad See Ew, a calamari special, and I ordered a bowl of the Tom Yum Soup. \\n\\nThe Pad See Ew was delicious, and felt like the perfect comfort food on a colder evening. We ordered it with veggies, and they were perfectly cooked--not too soggy, but also not too crunchy. I was pleasantly surprised by the Thai calamari we had, it wasn't something I'd typically order at a Thai place, but the sauce was awesome, and the little fried calamari's rivaled that of the best Italian places. The Tom Yum soup is soon to be my new go to dish. Once again, it has that feeling of comfort food. Judging on the proximity of this place to my house, I can tell I will be ordering this for take out often. \\n\\nWe did something very out of character for the group and ordered dessert after eating. I'm not a sweets girl, but EVERYONE SHOULD TRY THE DESSERT HERE. I can't recommend the dessert rice dishes more, they were spectacular. We had one with rice and mango--it's almost like a sweet risotto. Their desserts rotate on a seasonal basis, but they typically will have a rice one on the menu.

The sauce was flavorful and plentiful, yet light...not overly thick, oily, or sticky, as some pad thai sauces can be. The \"three flavored chicken\" was also tasty with its crispy, breaded chunks of white meat chicken. The sauce was interesting and unlike anything I\\'ve ever had before. Despite its name, I really only tasted two flavors that dominated the sauce -- vinegar (sour) and sugar (sweet). It could have used some spice to round it out, but even so, it was still delicious. I do wish it had some broccoli or other vegetable in it so I at least felt a little less guilty about eating copious amounts of fried chicken chunks :)  And overall, for our tastes, both dishes definitely could have kicked up the spice intensity. We had ordered both at a level 8, and as I said, I couldn\\'t really detect any spice at all. So if that was an 8, next time I\\'ll probably order a 33. :)\\n\\nOverall, this is very yummy Thai food.

       "  u'Came back to my favorite restaurant for dinner after not being here for MONTHS (is that a sin?) and I was SO excited.\\n\\nWe had to start off with the crab rangoons- of course. Thai Cuisine has them down to a T. They were perfect and the sauce was awesome.\\n\\nI wanted to try something different, so per our wonderful server\\'s suggestion- my friend and I split the eggplant entr\\xe9e with beef and the spicy basil noodles with chicken. We ordered both at a whopping 11 (1-10 heat scale). After talking with our server about Thai heat levels, he informed us that if we enjoy spicy food we should order above the \"American 10\". He told us that \"Thai hot\" is a 15. We took a chance with ordering it at 11 (I normally stick with the 5-6 range) and it was a good decision! The food was AWESOME and wasn\\'t too spicy at all. The eggplant dish was amazing- the chili garlic sauce was OUT of this world and of course, they are always generous with the sauce- which I adore. The spicy basil noodles were amazing.. I have been dreaming about those noodles ever since.\\n\\nWhen it comes to Thai food, Thai Cuisine is where it\\'s at. The food is AWESOME, the service is always consistent and wonderful and they are also BYOB. You can\\'t beat it.'],\n",

       "  u\"Thai Cuisine is the slightly pricier of the two Thai places near my house, so for super casual takeout purposes I usually just go to Thai Gourmet. Their Pad Thai is delicious and enough for four meals. I also adore the girls who work the front of the house there. Thai Cuisine's food tends to be a bit more flavorful however, and sometimes that's just what I want without having to drive somewhere. \\n\\nMy boyfriend and I ordered from here the other night, and I must say I think we'll be back for a sit-down meal fairly soon! I tried their version of Pad Thai since I hadn't had that in a while, and he had spicy basil friend rice. The Pad Thai had a tamarind sauce, which I've been led to believe is more authentic. Authentic or not it had that red spicy edge that I prefer in Pad Thai, and I couldn't get enough of it! Most Pad Thai around here is a sweet brown sauce, which is fine but not as complex. The Thai place near my mother's house makes their Pad Thai the way I like it, and I've been on an unofficial hunt to track down a similar version of the dish nearer to where I live. The hunt is now over! The portions here are a bit smaller for the higher price point, but the taste and quality balances it out very well. The service has also been great whenever I've come in, something else that I really appreciate. I'll for sure be back for more takeout and with visiting friends for a proper dinner very soon.\"],\n",

       "  u'Don\\'t waste your money!!! \\nWhen I moved to Brookline about 8 years ago, I thought this was a pretty decent restaurant. We always went for wing night, and the wings were very large and quite tasty. My favorite sauce was the honey jalapeno. While the wings were decent and cheap for the size, I had from day one thought the beers were a bit overpriced for the type of bar and location.  The wings kept me coming back, and they were cheap, so I didn\\'t mind paying a little bit more for a few beers. As time went on, the menu seemed to go through a few changes...a few less items, and higher prices, and severely decreased portion sizes. I understand that as with anything, prices are always going to go up, but at the same time, the quality should remain the same or get better! This was not the case here, after giving them a few tries, I gave up. On my last few visits the food was absolutely awful, the portions were minuscule, and overall overpriced. They also did away with the 50 cent wing night. It always seemed that all the owner was concerned with was the almighty dollar. I tried the the corned beef sandwich just after St. Patty\\'s day last year, and the corned beef was almost all fat, it was so bad that they took the sandwich and had me order a new item from the menu. After that I tried the fish and chips around lent, and what a joke it was! You got potato chips ( not home made), and a few tiny pieces of fish that were almost all breading. All of the \"specials\" that they have, whether they are food or drink, are not worth the prices that this place seems to think that they are. All of their \"special\" prices are what most other places have as their regular everyday prices! Definitely stay away, and give your money to a local establishment that is more deserving of your money!'],\n",

The staff was very nice, but we waited 20 mins for a table as we were seated at 6pm the waitress asks us for our order & 2 out of 3 of us had our heart set on the traditional Corn beef n Cabbage dinner, her reply was we are out of that for a while now! That info should have been given to us before we waited to be seated so we could have gone elsewhere, and My dinner was \"Irish Lamb Stew\" I counted the lamb pieces in that stew I got 4 tiny little chunks so I paid for mashed potatoes & lamb gravy it was terrible and expensive.

YUM!!!  we bought a bottle the next day. we'll probably empty out the state store!!!\\nfinally, the 6th course! dessert!!! what i've been waiting for through the whole meal!!! i had 1 tinsy space left for it! good thing too!!! individual chocolate pecan pies with caramel sauce, ganache  & whipped cream with chocovine wine. it was all so worth the pain i felt from being too full!!! the chocovine wine comes in several flavors. it's like a yoohoo for adults!!! we also bought a bottle of that, in espresso flavor, when we went to the state store! (side note- it's also delish with the bailey's irish cream cake from signature desserts!!!)\\ni would suggest that they give the entire menu when they advertize. most people want to know what they're paying for, especially for that kind of money. the next 1 is the end of may. i'm already counting the days! if you're looking for a fantasic evening out with excellant food, this is the ticket! i hope that this is just the tip of new things to come!!!\"],\n",

I was expecting (due to the negative reviews) a real s***hole, but upon entering, the decor is actually very pleasant.  It does not have that typical bar, rundown, needs updating appearance.  And from what I was able to observe, they try to keep it clean; even the Men's bathroom was clean.  The servers were not just wiping the tables clean, either.  They were spraying them with sanitizer and THEN wiping them.\\nOn to the food.  As I said, it was lunchtime, and they had a pretty good crowd for lunch.  It took a while for our server to get to us, but once she did, the service was excellent.  Prompt drink service and didn't have to ASK for refills.  She kept our glasses full.  Everyone enjoyed their food (a burger, club sandwich, and 2 different salads).  Not only did the food TASTE good, the presentation was excellent as well.  Nobody in our party ordered dessert; we were all too full.  They DO have a dessert case with some scrumptious looking selections, though.\\nWe all agreed we would return to The Getaway Cafe.\\nAs I said before, all of the negative reviews of this place made me a bit skeptical.\\nI am glad we checked it out anyways.\\nBased on the fact that my daughter lives in this neighborhood now, we WILL return.  And when I do, I will update this review.  If the food/service/decor changes, so will the rating.  Based on 1 visit, though, I was impressed.\\nOh, one more thing.  I saw several complaints in previous reviews about this place being overpriced.  I'd say they are about average.  The days of the $5 hamburger are about gone.  This is 2013.  While they may be a buck or two higher than some places, our bill for lunch for a party of 4 (drinks included, tax included) was $44.  Considering that a value meal at McDonald's is about $6 now, that's not too bad.\"],\n",

       "  u'My boyfriend and I stopped into the Getaway last night to catch the last two periods of the Pens vs. Kings game. We arrived around 7:30 and it wasn\\'t crowded so we took a couple of seats at the bar. Rose, the bartender, was quick to ask us what we wanted to drink. Of course I chose a Southern Tier 2X IPA and he chose a Yuengling, Rose knew all of her regulars and was friendly with everyone. The owners were actually sitting at the bar at the same time and seemed to know most of the regulars as well. For my meal, I ordered the getaway signature wrap (romaine lettuce, tomatoes, walnuts, diced chicken, mandarin oranges and feta cheese, drizzled with balsamic dressing). I asked for no walnuts and a nice surprise as well was the fact that there were craisins in the wrap too. With just the right amount of balsalmic spread throughout the wrap, this was very tasty. I chose fries as my side and those were good as well. My boyfriend has eaten here several times and said the wings (particularly the cajun) are tasty as is the quesadilla (which is so huge you can order just a half), and the Reuben, however, last night he chose the steak hoagie (Thin sliced grilled sirloin and provolone \\ncheese on a toasted 8\" hoagie roll with lettuce and tomatoes). He said it was tasty and he would order it again. Their desserts are from Signature desserts and they all looked delicious! We chose the pumpkin cheesecake. It had just the right amount of pumpkin flavor and was not overpowering. A very tasty seasonal treat!

The chips were homemade and crisp-kettle cooked how I prefer them. For apps our table got cajun wings (I did not try these) and a Buffalo chicken pita pizza ( grilled chicken set atop pita bread with Buffalo sauce and ranch dressing) and the pita pizza was 4 pieces so it could easily be a full meal too-which is exactly what I think I'll do next visit.

We tried to catch the attention of another waitress but could not. The kids could eat their pizza and quesadilla with their hands but we needed napkins. My wife ended up going to the bathroom for paper towels. \\n\\nIt became comical after 15 or 20 minutes when my boys were done eating and our steak salad and steak hoagie did not come out. At that point, the table behind us caught another waitress walking by, \"We\\'ve been waiting for 15 minutes for our check.\" We weren\\'t the only ones forgotten here. We couldn\\'t even ask for our son\\'s ginger ale or silverware for the table because nobody stopped by to check on us and our waitress was missing for over 20 minutes.\\n\\nWhen our food finally came out, we had been there for almost an hour. The kids were done eating so I asked if she could wrap it up. \"I\\'ll bring you some boxes.\" Seriously? I could almost understand that response if we were troublesome. We didn\\'t have the opportunity. In the hour that we had been there, the only contact with the staff was being seated, ordering, and receiving drinks and half of our food. The few touches we did have were decidedly negative.\\n\\nAs I sat there packing up my own food while my family got their coats on, I decided to write this review. What an awful experience. \\n\\nThe food was just OK. The quesadilla had bacon in it. Fine I guess but just call it a chicken bacon ranch quesadilla and serve ranch dressing instead of sour cream. Otherwise, just make a decent quesadilla. The kids pizza was fine. The steak salad tasted fine at our kitchen table. The steak was the best part. The rest was mostly head lettuce with a few tomatoes and cucumbers with shredded cheese on top. (Go to Armstrong\\'s if you want to have it done right.) My steak hoagie was actually two mini sandwiches. They soaked the bread in butter making a fat pill even bigger. I wouldn\\'t recommend it. Bellisario\\'s across the street does it way better.

       "  u\"Fiori's is always great pizza - especially when you're on the way home from town and hungry.  It's open late, and usually packed on the weekends.  My recommendation, however, is to go to Campitis (a few blocks away, on Potomac Ave in Dormont) if it's not too late, as they have the best pizza in Dormont.  But you'll never go wrong here, either. Quick, good pizza, and always a pleaser.\"],\n",

       "  u\"i highly recommend this pizza.  i'm a fan of several different pizza styles and this is a good old medium crust style.  it's more on the side of ny style pizza with that medium sized crust.  i tried a large mushroom with half pepperoni.  they bury the pepperoni under the cheese (minus one star).  i prefer seeing the pepperoni because of the fact we only wanted half the pizza with pepp and couldn't tell which side was which.  we had leftovers and i wasn't as big of a fan of the cold pizza from here.  i will say though, this pizza fresh from the oven- the best i've had yet here in pittsburgh.\"],\n",

I order the pizza well done because it is a little softer and that makes it much better! I dare someone to try this and not love it... The workers and always super fast and completely on top of everything... The only downfall is that the pizza is a little more expensive over other pizza places... but it's worth it!\"],\n",

       "  u'This is a dive.  A true dive.  The lack of pretentiousness and extraneous decor in the building are mirrored in the food that you get here.  I would recommend staying away during popular hours due to the fact that the parking is somewhat difficult -- the scant parking is on the side of the building and on the side of the road going up the steep hill.  \\n\\nIt really doesn\\'t matter if you will be dining in or carrying out, you need to walk to the counter first to place your order.  If you have more than one person in your group, all the better since they can be on the look-out for a coveted table.  Once you order, pay for it.  On my first time here, I sat down and waited to be served -- they won\\'t come.  I then ordered at the counter and was given the option of paying before or after the meal and I chose after -- the people making the food will assume you haven\\'t arrived and will go slow in the preparation, PAY!\\n\\nWith the niceties out of the way, you can focus on finding a table or just sit back and relax if someone in your crew already found one.  I have been here twice already and these people just don\\'t stop.  It is a well-greased assembly line that only lets you down if you don\\'t follow the proper path (look at the above paragraph).  Both times I contented myself to watch the large numbers of people that enter through this pizza parlours doors while we waited on our order:\\n\\nFirst Trip only:\\nGarlic bread\\nHot wings\\n\\nBoth Trips:\\nMeatballs (x2) and red sauce\\nPepperoni Pizza with Extra Cheese (12\" - 8 cut)\\n\\nThe meatballs, wings, and bread came out rather quickly.  The garlic bread was nothing special, just a loaf brushed with a garlic oil and warmed.  Very simple, but somewhat weak in the garlic department.  The buffalo wings were good.  They were not hot/piquant; but they actually had good flavor and that is really what counts.  They were slightly more acidic than many of the wings that I have had in the area and that went well with a little bit of blue cheese.  The meatballs were about the size of a racketball.  Very little to no seasoning in both the sauce and the meatballs.  I was quite surprised to find that I enjoyed them.  The small number of ingredients that go into making this simple sauce and meatball had to be in proper proportion each time to get that wonderful flavor -- so far they are batting 2/2.  \\n\\nOur pizza arrived steaming hot and smelling wonderful.  I could tell from the small bits of brown that were beginning in the cheese that the pizza had been cooked fully and to the proper temperature.  There is nothing worse than a pizza that is pulled too soon.  I ate my first piece and was amazed at the flavors.  The pizza, overall, had a sweet undertone.  As I started on my second piece, I began to take more note of the flavors.  The crust had a slightly sweet flavor, was a tad doughy/soft, but was super thin and had a very good flavor.  The sauce was also sweet; it tasted like the sauce that came with the meatballs.  Tasting the pepperoni, again there was this sweet undertone to it.  \\n\\nI must say, I am not usually a fan of sweet foods, but this wasn\\'t unnaturally sweet and it was tasting good.  What amazed me the most was the near-perfect execution of the pizza with so few ingredients and none of the usual and stereotypical Italian seasonings.  Yeah, I enjoyed this pizza.  It is definitely the best I have had in Pittsburgh.  I will be returning for my pizza fix again and again and again...  \\n\\nThey only accept cash, if you have none there is a convenient ATM near the singles/kiddie bar.  They are open until 3am on the weekends, so if you get a late night hankering for pizza you are in luck.  Just be advised you will have to then battle the post-bar crowd.\\n\\nNOTE:  If you must have the Italian seasoning, you won\\'t like this pizza.  Also, be careful of ordering too many toppings or extra cheese as the crust is so thin and has a hard time holding it up -- not an issue if you eat with a fork.'],\n",

One thing about Pitt pizza... it is slightly different than true NYC style:  the crust is not as thin and there\\'s a whole lot more cheese.  As a rule Pitt pizza also has a slightly sweeter tomato sauce.

I\\'ll try them next time I\\'m in the \\'burgh.\\n\\nI can\\'t imagine anybody beating out Fiori\\'s.  Their \"cuts\" (Pittsburgh parlance for \"slice\") were a perfect Pittsburgh version of NY style pizza.\\n\\nFiori\\'s to me was the best in Pittsburgh because it had the perfect amounts of chew, char, crust, cheese, sauce.\\n\\nThe place itself has a perfect old school been-in-the-neighborhood-for-years vibe with a couple of tables and booths.

       "  u\"When I heard about the slightly sweet sauce served on a Fiori's Pizza, I was doubtful about whether or not this would be a place for me. I have to say overall I liked it- but with a few caveats.\\n\\nParking stinks.  Don't bother eating in, just get take out. Grab a friend, have them drive and run in to pick up your pie. My quick bite of pizza took over two hours from finding a parking space, standing in line to order, waiting for my pizza to be made, getting a table with said pizza (there is very limited seating for eating in), eating and finally wriggling past the other waiting people to get out to search for the car. The place is CASH ONLY, no credit cards so make sure you got a twenty to buy your pie. (Fortunately they have an ATM on site but the fees!)\\n\\nAll my complaints aside, I did enjoy my pizza. The sweetness of the sauce was balanced by the saltiness of the olives they exuberantly provided on my pizza. The crowd of people in there provided for a quite interesting people-watching experience. The slices of pizza were unevenly divided and my eating companions were quick to grab what might have been fold-able slices, but I feel like folding was a possibility for the crust.\\n\\nOverall, I'd go back.\"],\n",

In a word: forgettable.\\n\\nThe last take-out pie we got was less than pleasing to the eye. All the cheese was on half the pie. The onions were diced - an interesting choice - and I actually liked that they were raw. The green peppers seemed to have been cut willy nilly, but that's OK. It's not 5-star, it's pizza. The pizza has a sweet taste to it, and I can't can't if it's the sauce or the dough, but I suspect the former. \\n\\nOverall, I'd eat it again, but wouldn't go out of my way. I suspect it would be really delicious cold, for breakfast.\"],\n",

The pizza was just sweet without much other taste, almost like ketchup!  Definitely not a fan of sweet pizza...I don't know why it is so popular but most people tend to like sweet food and drinks...but not me...I want some flavors and spice!\\n\\nThe wings were so average....not anything I would order again....my son ate one and said he was done...amazing!\\n\\nI know!

       "  u\"My stepfather-in-law gave me sage advice about finding good pizza. If you don't know the pizza in an area, look for the dirtiest, rundown place you can find, and you'll find the best pizza in town. The thinking behind that is, if the place looks that bad but is still in busines, then there is a reason they're still in business. And in my experiences, it's almost always true.\\n\\nFiori's is a dive (in a good way)- the inside looks like it was put together in the '70's, and the staff isn't always the friendliest. Forget about parking- there are three spots on the side of the building and perilious street parking on the hill. The later in the evening you go, the busier the dining room. My suggestion is don't eat here- you're only asking for drama.\\n\\nBut then you get home with that steaming pie, and all the parking nonsense, questionable customer service, and wait in line vanishes as you're enveloped in cheesey, meaty goodness. The pizzas are big, there are a ton of toppings, and the sauce is sweet in a good way. My suggestion is try their white pizza, which I think rivals the ones I've had in New York. I get mine with ricotta cheese, mushrooms, and meatballs- I'm drooling just thinking about it. I also suggest you try their italian hoagie- big, lots of meat, good dressing, and toasted in a crunchy way- my favorite in Pittsburgh.\"],\n",

In our half an hour there, I must have seen 8 different chance occurrences between people in town.\\n\\nOnto the pizza!  We got a 16 inch pie for just over 12 dollars!  Thin crust that was crispy, not overly cheesy or saucy--although the sauce did have a distinct sweet flavor.  Baked to perfection--lightly golden brown.  Enjoyable flavor!  If you have been to Grimaldi's in Brooklyn, it's a similar style with a different taste.  \\n\\nOverall: the pizza is good, atmosphere is easy! Don't listen to the haters, although parking is a pain.\"],\n",

       "u'STAY AWAY...\\nWe\\'ve been 3 times over the past few years, each time we say \"let\\'s try it again\" followed by \"wish we\\'d done something else\".\\n\\nReminds me of the movie line \"Run away, run very far away\"\\n\\nLast nite after Steelers/Jets was last straw. I hope the owner or general manager reads this. And think the health department should too.\\n\\nService is mediocre and slow. consistently. Waitress was ok in attitude.\\n\\nAfter our soup starter (good french onion soup) we waited and waited and waited and waited for our mains. Noticing us staring at her, waitress stopped by, went into kitchen, came back and said we were next. my watch said 8:31. Then her manager came by and argued with me and said we were next, then at 8:52pm the horrible food finally arrived. That\\'s 21 minutes to be next. In that time we watched 4 tables turn from being seated to drinks to mains to check down while we waited for our main. \\n\\nManager embarrassed himself. Said they were busy and working our food and he had checked and would come soon. I told him about the 4 tables turning and he said no they didn\\'t. then I said I used to manage restaurants and know what customer service and ticket times are and he challenged me and said no I didn;t and I had no idea what I was talking about. What an idiot! First rule of restaurant business is the customer is always right.\\n\\nThen the food arrived. How hard is it to do chicken marsala with mushrooms, seriously? It was two soggy fried chicken tenders from the deep fryer (not pan sauteed) over a bowl of bowtie pasta with shrooms and a sauce. While the sauce did have some marsala in it, it was full of sour cream and tasted like stroganoff and a little funny. The Penne ala vodka was sauteed canned tomatoes and no flavor. We were so hungry we ate most and left.\\n\\n1 hour later I was sick on the side of the road from the dinner and still feel really rough this morning.'"
