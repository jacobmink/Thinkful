       "  u\"Owning a driving range inside the city limits is like a license to print money.  I don't think I ask much out of a driving range.  Decent mats, clean balls and accessible hours.  Hell you need even less people now with the advent of the machine that doles out the balls.  This place has none of them.  It is april and there are no grass tees yet.  BTW they opened for the season this week although it has been golfing weather for a month.  The mats look like the carpet at my 107 year old aunt Irene's house.  Worn and thread bare.  Let's talk about the hours.  This place is equipped with lights yet they only sell buckets of balls until 730.  It is still light out.  Finally lets you have the pit to hit into.  When I arrived I wasn't sure if this was a driving range or an excavation site for a mastodon or a strip mining operation.  There is no grass on the range. Just mud.  Makes it a good tool to figure out how far you actually are hitting the ball.  Oh, they are cash only also.\\n\\nBottom line, this place sucks.  The best hope is that the owner sells it to someone that actually wants to make money and service golfers in Pittsburgh.\"],\n",

And if you finish even a minute after 8, don't plan on getting a drink.  The vending machines are sold out (of course) and they sell drinks inside, but close the drawers at 8 on the dot.  There are weeds grown all over the place.  I noticed some sort of batting cage, but it looks like those are out of order as well.

Yards were indeed marked and there are some targets to aim for, and even some hazards to aim away from. \\n\\nA big red flag to me was the extra charge ($3) to hit off the grass. I am no range expert, but this is the 4th one I've been to and the first I've seen of that sort of nickel and diming....\\n\\nPrice for the golf balls was reasonable and I do plan to be back every week until they close up in October for the season.

Both dishes were massive, and could very easily be shared between two people.  On top of being extremely large portions, it was incredibly affordable.  The giant fish sandwich was $8 and the giant Reuben was $7.50.  Our drinks were always filled and we were checked on several times during the meal.  We will definitely be back!!!

       "  u\"After a morning of Thrift Store hunting, a friend and I were thinking of lunch, and he suggested Emil's after he'd seen Chris Sebak do a bit on it and had tried it a time or two before, and I had not. He said they had a decent Reuben, but to be prepared to step back in time.\\n\\nWell, seeing as how I'm kind of addicted to late 40's and early 50's, and the whole Rat Pack scene, stepping back in time is a welcomed change in da burgh...as long as it doesn't involve 1979, which I can see all around me every day.\\n\\nAnd yet another shot at finding a decent Reuben in da burgh...well, that's like hunting the Holy Grail. So looking under one more bush certainly wouldn't hurt.\\n\\nSo off we go right at lunchtime in the middle of...where exactly were we? At first I thought we were lost, driving around a handful of very rather dismal looking blocks in what looked like a neighborhood that had been blighted by the building of a highway. And then...AHA! Here it is! And yep, there it was. This little unassuming building with an add-on entrance with what looked like a very old hand painted sign stating quite simply 'Emil's. \\n\\nWe walked in the front door, and entered another world. Another time, and another place. Oh, and any Big Burrito/Sousa foodies might as well stop reading now. I wouldn't want to see you walk in, roll your eyes and say 'Reaaaaaalllly?'\\n\\nThis is about as old world bar/lounge/restaurant as it gets. Plain, with a dark wood bar on one side, plain white walls with no yinzer pics, good sturdy chairs and actual white linens on the tables. This is the kind of neighborhood dive that I could see Frank and Dino pulling a few tables together for some poker, a fish sammich, and some cheap scotch. And THAT is exactly what I love.\\n\\nOh...but good food counts too. \\n\\nWe each had a Reuben, and my friend had a side of fries. The Reubens were decent, but not NY awesome. A little too thick on the bread, but overall, tasty and definitely filling. Not too skimpy on the meat. I seriously CRAVE a true, good NY Reuben, but since I can't afford to travel right now, what I find in da burgh will have to do. But as we sat and ate, burgers came out to an adjoining table. Those were some big thick burgers. A steak went past for the table behind us. That was HUGE! And when we asked about it, the waitress said 'Yeah, it's huge and really good, and he only charges $12.99 for it, ain't that nuts?' Another table of five came in, and wham. Fish sandwiches PILED with breaded fish that looked amazing. Yeah, I want that, that, that and THAT!\\n\\nMy friend also mentioned that they have a Chicken Parm special one day of the week that is only served UNTIL 4 pm, and that it is fantastic. If only I could GET there on that week day before 4...\\n\\nThe waitress did a good job, especially since there was quite a growing crowd at lunchtime on a Saturday, and only one of her. She kept up and was very friendly. \\n\\nThey only have Pepsi products, so I had a brewed iced tea, which was very fresh, and she did pop by to ask about refills as often as she could. As the lunch hour went on, they were getting busy.\\n\\nEmil's is no frills, good portions, very reasonable prices, VERY comfortable neighborhood hole in the wall...kind of like Cheers, but in a blue collar neighborhood in the 1950's.

A pound of fish on a fish-shaped bun (as opposed to da burgh's seemingly popular hamburger bun). The fish was flavorful, the batter excellent, and for just $8.

       "  u\"From reading the other reviews, I see this place was on some top 25 places in Pittsburgh list a few years ago.  I haven't seen it myself, but have known of this place for a while before my first visit in 2013.  It wasn't until my almost 80yo buddy, Mr. Italo Donatucci (world's coolest old Italian dude) brought me one of the best fish sandwiches I ever had that I became hooked!  I've had at least 10 since then, but only during the Lent season.  I gave my 5 rating based on the fish sandwich alone.  Try it without a bun also!  Either way you get 3 nice size pieces of fish equal to a pound.  You can have your choice of sides, but I always get the small mac n cheese for my side.  The staff is always really friendly and service is prompt.  It's in a rough neighborhood, but the Rankin police station is right across the street.  Almost every visit there I have seen police officers inside mingling with the locals or picking up lunch orders.  Soon I plan to make a visit that's not a Friday during Lent to try other menu items.\"],\n",

       "  u\"I had a hankering for some fried fish tonight and the fish fry at Maximilian Kolbe was going to close before I got home on the bus, and I suggested to my wife and 12 year-old daughter that we try Emil's lounge as WQED's Rick Seback loved the place as did Andrew Zimmern when he visited for the Bizarre Foods America episode featuring Pittsburgh.  \\n\\nThe place is in Rankin - a rough around the edges town in the Mon Valley between Swissvale and Braddock.  Don't be put off at first - the outside doesn't have much decoration to speak of and looks like the sort of place that you might think twice about it.  A TGI Fridays it isn't... And thank god for that.\\n\\nThe place is well-kept but a little dated -  no fripperies here.  But we're not here for the Decor - we're here for some dinner.  \\n\\nThe menu is basic with reasonable prices.  The meats and seafood are high quality and everything is made to order.  Their stuffed cabbage is regarded as the best in  Pittsburgh.  I love stuffed cabbage but I just made a batch a couple of weeks ago and I'm cabbaged out.  Their Ruebens are   also killer (our waitress raved about them).  My wife and I both settled on fish sandwiches.  These are true Pittsburgh fish Sammiches - fresh fried fish in crispy breading, crammed between enormous pillows of soft, yet chewy and crispy Mancini's Italian bread.  No adornments - just a boatload of hot crispy fish.  Emil's uses thick cod fillets piled high rather than a thin fillet that needs to be broken up to fit in the bun.  Truly a great sandwich.  My daughter had the BLT - looked good and on good bread and they weren't skimpy with the bacon.\\n\\nThe service was very pleasant and friendly and the crowd was a great group of folks.  We all had fun with 4 other tables when my wife pulled up a Trivial Pursuit game on her iPhone and pretty much everyone joined in and had a good laugh.\\n\\nOverall, if you consider yourself a true Pittsburgher - you must visit this place.  It's one of the few places (Big Jim's in the Run is another) where the spirit of Pittsburgh is alive and hungry.  Please go.\"],\n",

The other waiter was wearing a hooded cardigan, and I wanted to steal it from him due to my difficulty in finding such a quality article of clothing.\\n\\nWe ordered a white pizza - large in size, engulfed in cheese, full of garlic flavor, flavorful hot sausage. An overall delicious pizza, aside from 2 things: 1, way too much grease (I know this comes with the territory, but still, it is sometimes unbearable); 2, CANNED MUSHROOMS - the worst thing to come out of a can. Ever. I would rather eat canned Alpo than canned mushrooms. And if the mushrooms weren't canned, they were just the worst mushrooms I've ever consumed. The mushroom debacle is enough to lower the review by an entire star - disgusting!\\n\\nMy advice for the place is keep everything awesome - random music from the jukebox, tasty food, great prices, good crowd and staff - and get some decent mushrooms; why they spoil an otherwise above average pie with such inferior crap, I'll never know.\"],\n",

       "  u'I will start by saying we have a nice new deck. That is where the good part ends.\\n\\nWhy two stars if we have a nice deck now? Well, it all started in May when we had a man named Al come out and talk to us about the process. He was a true salesman, I\\'ll tell you that. Not a straight shooter, but an excited salesman that wanted to sell... And we bought into it.\\n\\nHe told us they were backed up with the harsh winter and a lot of jobs, but they could probably start by June 24th. Mind you, this was the end of May we met with him. He said they would have to do a survey of our land and get a permit from Dormont before they started. We felt confident in going with them, and booked it.\\n\\nHere\\'s where things fell apart. Weeks went by with no word from them on the process. Finally I called and left messages. Al finally got in touch with me and the conversation was utterly confusing. He must have not understood me because he just kept talking in circles. So I hung up not knowing what was going on. Finally I called back and the admin told me that the survey could take a couple weeks to come back. I wish Al would have told us that.\\n\\nSo our June 24th date came and went. We finally got our survey. And they were quick to bill us for it, but no word on where we were in the process. I called back a couple times with no real answers from the admin. Apparently they were now waiting for the permit from Dormont.\\n\\nA month later, I was frustrated and asked to speak with someone at the company. I spoke with someone who told me that Dormont usually takes a week to process the permit, but we were now going on a month. He told me he would bug the guy about it and we finally got it. \\n\\nI completely understand that waiting on the permit is not their fault, but why no communication about it? Just call me and tell me they\\'re waiting for the permit, but they\\'ll work towards asking Dormont what the hold up is. Seems simple.\\n\\nFinally we get the permit and work is supposed to start. Tuesday comes and they have to wait for approval from Dormont on holes they\\'re digging. So holes are dug and equipment is put in my backyard and then nothing happens for two days. Where did everyone go? Who knows, because I wasn\\'t informed! \\n\\nI was upset and contacted the company owner, Dave, by email. I told him how frustrated I was about the lack of communication. He wrote me two sentences that  said \"there will be acres there tomorrow morning to finish and most will be done tomorrow.\" Well, that didn\\'t happen.\\n\\nThen two other dudes show up two days later and did work for about three hours and left. The main guy comes back the next day and says they did it wrong. So apparently the part about how they wouldn\\'t need access to my house changes to they\\'re drilling bolts into my house to secure he deck. \\n\\nFinally, the second week into construction, my tiny 10x11 foot deck is done. It was upsetting that they left the deck dirty, and all the dirt and cement they moved around wasn\\'t cleaned up. I even asked them to fill all the holes they dug up and didn\\'t use, and they only filled up one. When you create a construction project, isn\\'t it just good business to clean it up and make it look nice? Didn\\'t happen here.\\n\\nMy main point is, contractors have a reputation for not being the most trustworthy. Why be that company? Why not be an upstanding company that consumers can trust? My main issues with them were that things were not communicated to me properly up front, nor was the ongoing process communicated to me. Then they left everything unfinished in my eyes, leaving the site dirty. I understand things happen and things get delayed, but just email or call me. It\\'s not that hard to keep me updated, it is 2014 with a million ways to be contacted.\\n\\nEven though I have a nice deck (after I clean things up myself!), I would not recommend them to anyone.'],\n",

I ordered coffee and water, which she went and got while I looked over the menu.  She returned, and took my order.  I ordered the Cinnamon Swirl French Toast Special - Three slices of French toast made with Pittsburgh's own Jenny Lee\\xae Cinnamon Swirl, two farm-fresh eggs, with bacon or sausage (I chose sausage), and your choice of potato (I went with the cheesy hash brown casserole).  I also added an orange juice.  She went and put my order in, while I waited, and came back with it after not too long.   The eggs were cooked exactly how I wanted them, the cheesy hash brown casserole and the french toast were both delicious.  I also enjoyed the sausage which was pretty typical.\\n\\nKings Family Restaurant featured a very friendly staff, great prices, and tasty food.  I am pleased and will definitely come back again.\"],\n",

       "  u\"Two meals, on the recommendation of a friend who lives near the place, and after the second trip, I was compelled to write. 'Rocky' would definitely describe the experiences.\\n\\nOn the first trip, I went to try their (at that time)raved about Reuben. And YET to find a true good Reuben in da burgh, I tried it.\\n\\nWell, they were out of the proper bread, and the guy had to run to the store to buy the closest thing he could find, which was not the proper bread, and instead of one of their 'raved about' Reubens, I received two mini-Reubens, which basically took the guts from one Reuben, and spread it out onto two sandwiches on regular sized bread. I ate it. It wasn't great, but they swore it was because they'd run out of the bread. Bread or not, it still wasn't great. The atmosphere was pleasant in that 'blue collar bar' kind of way, and the staff was very nice, but not a winning pitch on the Reuben.\\n\\nThe second trip was after a long day of moving furniture with the same friend. Sat in the back room, instead of the bar, which felt more like a restaurant, of course, with the big screen TV covering the sports of the moment.\\n\\nI was in the mood for dinner this time, and after a scan, decided on fried chicken and mashed potatoes with the salad bar. My friend ordered one of her faves, the breaded pork chops.\\n\\nWe hit the salad bar, which was uber-basic. Three soups (mostly vegetable loaded, which left me out), basic iceberg lettuce mix (very probably out of a bag), a few veggie toppings, and three or four dressings. It was a basic salad, no big deal. More or less an appetizer filler before the meal.\\n\\nThe mind-blower in this trip was the ordering of the fried chicken dinner. Our waiter looked like a 19 year old gas station attendant, skinny little blonde guy with a sweet but incredibly naive face, and an air of vapidity, which was confirmed when I placed my order. I asked what chicken pieces came in the dinner, and asked if it was possible to only get dark meat. I never imagined how confusing a question that could possibly be. It literally took him two trips back to the kitchen to 'ask', and the child honestly had no clue what 'white meat' and 'dark meat' meant. The first answer he came back with was that the chicken came in a pre-portioned prepared bag, kind of Kentucky Fried Chicken style...which didn't answer my question, thus prompting the second trip. \\n\\nAfter the second trip back I heard the cook holler 'Tell him I'll fix him up'. \\n\\nWell, the chicken was prepackaged dreck like you'd find in the freezer case of Walmart, tiny and not good, and the potatoes had that slight tinge of chem-spuds flavor, laden with some kind of chopped up green (parsley?), and a side of that basic brown gravy served up in 5 gallon buckets.\\n\\nThank goodness for the basic salad bar.\\n\\nEven my friend admitted that her pork chops were different and not what she'd expected. They also appeared to be from a freezer bag.\\n\\nThe irony was that the boy who didn't know white meat from dark meat, was chatting with some other customers...about baseball...and he was a genius about the mindless sport of baseball. Ahhhh da burgh.\\n\\nThird base? Nah...why bother when there are so many other options around. Go on in a grab a beer and chat black and gold if you happen to be in Carnegie...they can help you out all types of ways in that area. Just don't go hungry if you actually have tastebuds.\\n\\nFrom what I understand it 'used to be' really good homecooked food. But apparently, mama has left the kitchen.\"],\n",

A friend of mine who lived in the area recommended Rocky\\'s.  As I walked in the door I was pleasantly approached by the server and shown a table. It was clean, welcoming and the lounge was busy. It was Friday night and the special was the fish fry.  I ordered the fish and in the meantime I sipped on a draft brew.  The order was delivered to my table in no time.  The fish and sides were tasty and the portion size was large. As I was watching the game and enjoying the heck out of my dinner I noticed a dessert case with a nice selection of cakes.  Well needless to say I got a togo box for what was left of my dinner and ordered a slice of cheesecake.  Another good choice!

It was a struggle, but I was determined to enjoy every tasty morsel and not leave a crumb.   \\n\\nIn case anyone is wondering, yes, they use real butter.  I saw pounds of it stacked in the kitchen with my own two eyes.  The wait staff was quick and efficient as well as helpful and friendly with our larger group of 9 people.

The place is tucked at the end of a strip mall and you have to look to find it. There is plenty of parking.\\nInside the decor is quaint and funky at the same time. Country style decorations and signs are mixed with nostalgia signs & posters. Most interesting are all the signatures and comments written on the wall by past customers. We regretted not having a marker to add ours. The other highlight was three large white boards with trivia questions - fun way to spend time waiting for food.\\nThe waitstaff there is...uh, experienced. They are attentive, pleasant and efficient.\\nAfter reading reviews I had to try the Mixed Grill. But S went with pancakes with a side of bacon. The pancakes were outstanding...maybe the best either of us has eaten. They were thick but with light texture and rich flavor. \\nHis bacon was cooked just as requested - as crisp as possible - and very flavorful.\\nThe Mixed Grill is a mixed together concoction of eggs, potatoes, onions, peppers, cheese, and spicy Italian sausage grilled together. I'm glad I heeded those who stressed going with the half size order. It filled a full sized dinner plate with a heaping order. I couldn't finish it all and that's rare. How do they serve the whole potion -- in a trough?\\nEverything was cooked well. The sausage added a nice bite to offset the somewhat plain potatoes. You can build your own mix but the basic was a good mix.\\nMy only complaint was the amount of potato and that they are pretty plain. I like home fries with lots of seasoning that have aged on the grill. These potatoes were pretty uniform chunks with little seasoning. Personal preference.\\nIt usually comes with Italian toast but they were out so I went with raisin. It was delicious soft inch thick slices.\\nCoffee was excellent and the cup stayed full. The total was less than $15. Fabulous value for the quality and portions.\\nWhile I can't say it's the best breakfast in Pittsburgh (only here 3 days), its the best so far and one of the best we've had.\"],\n",

The ambience however is usually lacking. The walls are dark, with writing and signatures of semi famous people all over the place. Pictures of local people hang on the walls(i secretly want mine up there) along with posters galore. While its fun to look at the first 10 times, it gets a little boring after awhile. So today when I arrived I expected the same old experience. Wow was I wrong! As soon as I looked at the door I knew something was different. The place seemed lighter and brighter. To my pleasant surprise, they painted and got new counter tops!! They're not quite done yet but the place has a new Happy vibe to it. The awesome breakfast, the new decor and the 5 guys sitting at the counter making me laugh are why I will be back( maybe for lunch).\"],\n",

We didn't have to wait this time (Saturday morning at 10:30), but there was a wait throughout the time we were there. The menu is very basic- no specialty pancakes, waffles, or french toast and only 1 specialty omelette. There were no meal options, so if you want home fries or something, it's extra. The omelettes do include toast. (Great bread, btw!) We had to wait a while for our food, which was surprising because we've been to a lot of diners. My husband and I both got omelettes and agreed that the contents were not really cooked with the egg. It's almost like the egg was completely cooked and someone threw the cooked contents in there and just folded it over. As for my mushroom and cheese omelette, the cheese was lacking. My biggest peev about this place is that it's CASH ONLY. Perhaps I missed it, but I'm pretty sure this wasn't noted anywhere on the menu or the front door. Thankfully, we had enough to cover our bill, but's not a good way to end the meal when you're scrambling and digging for change.

The decor is tired and grimy, the place reeked of smoke, and the bartender/server was surly, to put it mildly. We went there on a Saturday night with a mind to try the Irish food. Apparently, we were out of luck. I\\'ve always thought that the secrets of restaurant success is to actually stock food for people to eat. He told us before we ordered that they had no \"pies\". No chicken pot pie, no shepherds pie, etc. So, we gamely tried to order other things. We placed our order. My wife, for example, ordered the Irish stew and he came back 5 min later telling us they were out of that and even more things for several people in our party. At that point my wife picked out a third option, ham and cabbage, only to be told again that \"they were out\". At that point, realizing that the only food to be had in the place was what was crusted on the menus, we asked to pay for our drinks and left. They actually then gave us flack for not having enough to put it on a debit card. In short, unless you like your dinner with a side of disappointment and depression, I\\'d probably avoid this place like the plague. Speaking of the plague, I suppose we should thank Mr. Surly for inspiring us to walk out.

The building is in a strip mall across from Carnegie Coffee Company.  Unassuming, looks like it is closed all the time, until you do a drive by and see the hours posted.

He asks you to go change into a closet (Yes, a closet to change in with one lightbulb) BUT all my worries aside, the moment he started working on my items I knew he was the real deal. He learned from his father at the age of 14 how to sew. and he does things the correct way.  Meaning, for example-  I took in a pair of khakis all the way down to the cuff, but he seamed them up to look EXACTLY the way they were when I first bought them.  Most placed will have bulges and puckers.  The rest of my items were just as perfect.  Very inexpensive at $10 for a pair of pants to adjust the hem.  The items were done in a timely manner.  He takes his business very seriously.  While I was there, I watched a lady rush in and demand 6 shirts to be altered in an hour, and he did it and charged the same price.

He never replaced the undertray which was damaged in the accident which would lead to problems down the road. He also forgot to cover the back of the car which got some overspray from the primer (How this happened when he painted the front of the car is beyond me. I\\'m assuming they were painting a car next to mine.)\\n\\nHere is where I am dissapointed with his service. After a week the bumper started falling off. Also the new headlight he put in started getting condensation in it which proved to me he never actually replaced it. I called and tried to set up an appointment but none of my messages were answered. After getting him on the phone he told me I needed to set up an appointment to come look at it. I showed up and he told me it would take more money to fix! Are you kidding me? The insurance company and I coughed up $6k so you could partially put it back together and then not want to fix it once it was falling apart? He told me I must have hit a curb and knocked the bumper off. He would not take responsibility for his lack of quality work. \\n\\nDO NOT GO HERE. I complained to Nationwide to remove them from their repair shop list but my complaints went unheard.\\n\\nI ended up going private party to redo his shotty work.'],\n",

       "  u\"I spoke to a man this morning about the ice covered parking lot and sidewalk, as a business is liable to their customers if someone was to slip and fall due to negligence on the business's part. He told me good luck and that I'm liable to just be careful because everywhere is icy. After two years at this gym I'm fed up with the way they treat their customers. He told me he was fed up with me since I gave him a hard time about being out of towels a few weeks ago (which they've had towels since then). They never clean the parking lot in the winter so make sure you wear boots outside and don't crash your car. Aside from that, this gym is well just that a gym. My biggest critic (aside from rude management and negligence) would have to be that they don't encourage sanitization outside of the cardio room. There aren't towels and spray around the weight machines, which I've never had an issue with, but I'd hate to see that happen. I always make sure to at least wipe off my sweat marks from the machine, cause well that'd be pretty nasty. It is pretty large in terms of size and space to do anything aside from the ordinary weights and cardio. The workers well they're mostly young and don't really care too much (the man who told me I was wrong was older and possibly a manager or owner). They tend to not keep on top of the wash with the towels even when it isn't busy, which can be pretty annoying. Their cardio room always has Fox News on two tvs and then the middle TV has sports center on regardless of what else is on tv. They recently haven't even been putting pens games and stuff on. Must be too busy watching the 52 inch screen they have in the lobby for the workers while the cardio room has max 32 in the middle and 24 on the sides probably. If I had to pay full price for my membership I probably wouldn't belong here, but it's through my insurance. That said I don't swipe my card like most people in the front on my own. The machine is behind the counter. One guy always shows me how to do it myself, which was helpful the first time cause people aren't always around the front desk. That said when he is standing behind there chatting I would expect him to do it since it's his job. This gym is nothing state of the art fancy fancy, but do you really need a fancy looking gym? Their cardio room is pretty massive and even at peak hours I've never had a problem getting a treadmill or elliptical. They actually even have two hellix trainers, which aren't super common yet. Sometimes when things go out of order they take a while to fix them. I've run into the owner or manager one time in the bathroom when someone let a sink over floor and asked if I should tell the guys at the desk and she said oh no they're useless. This gym makes a killing from a) classes b) it's convenient and c) their personal training is a separate company (warrior fitness). I've been meaning to sign up for a trainer and I always see them busy. They all seem awesome and very helpful and challenging. Not sure if they have a separate yelp page, but I would say from what I've seen they'd bust your ass for sure!\"],\n",

The owner and staff could not be more accommodating and strive for member satisfaction.  The owner not only runs the business but personally fixes machines when needed, interacts with the members, and also personally salts and plows the parking lot when needed in the winter himself.  \\nThere is another review on here stating the lot didn't have any attention after which was the largest ice storm we've had in years. I would like to state I was sitting by the counter the day this lady came in upset and unnecessarily yelling at the front desk employee about the lot.  The owner was out there every couple hours doing the best he could to tame the condition of the lot. However on that day I believe everyone's car on the road turned into a snow sled including my own.  If you truly felt in danger being on the roads that day, you probably should of just stayed at home or a work.\\nI love the fact the owner takes pride in his business and is extremely hands on with the maintenance of the building.

       "  u\"What a wonderful surprise found in Carnegie PA, just south of Pittsburgh.  I was in town on business with a couple co-workers and after having a not so great meal the night before, we asked one of the locals for a recomendation.  They told us to try this little Italian place called Papa J's and boy did they send us to a great place.\\n\\nFirst off, when you walk up to the place, the front and side windows give you a fantastic open view into the kitchen from the outside.  You can stand outside and watch the chef making all the wonderful food and you can smell the fresh bread before you even walk in the door.\\n\\nI am not sure how long this place has been around but the kitchen looked well used, while the dining area as well as the bar looked very clean and modern, almost as if it had been freshly updated.  \\n\\nThe server was quick to welcome us and suggested several different items off the menu as his favorites when asked.  The three of us were very hungry and wanting to try a few different things, so we began with a Margherita pizza which was absolutely perfect.  They obviously make their own breads and dough for the pizza and I don't think this pizza could have tasted any better.  Then came bowls of Italian wedding soup which was pretty good.  Of everything there, this was the one item I probably could have done without.  Not that it was bad, but there was nothing particularly special about it.  \\n\\nWe also ordered the Garlic Rolls (not that the bread they already give you and the pizza was not enough carbs for 1 meal) and they were to die for.  Crunchy on the outside and warm and chewy inside, these things were a meal by themselves.  One of the guys with me said the pizza sauce would be good on them so he ordered a cup of the pizza sauce (which is fresh made there, not out of some can) and he was right.  As if these little killer bread balls with garlic were not good enough, dipped in the pizza sauce they were even that much better.  \\n\\nBy the time our meals came, we were all pretty full, but we pushed on and continued to eat.  I had the Veal Parmigiano which was tender and very good.  It came with a side of pasta which I tasted just to try and it was excelent as well.  Had I not been eating a weeks worth of carbs in one sitting with all the pre-meal stuff, I certainly would have finished it.  As it was, I ate most but not all of the generous portion of veal.  \\n\\nOne of my co-workers had the Chicken Picatta which he said was one of the best he had ever had and the other guy tried a pasta dish which he said was very good as well.  \\n\\nThey had a great wine selection as well at reasonable prices by the glass or bottle.\\n\\nOverall a fantastic experience with great food and atmosphere.  I don't really know how expensive the area is for food, but coming from the Chicagoland area, I fouknd this place to be pretty reasonable.  The three of us ate very very well for an average of aproximately $30 each not including alcahol.  Fantastic fresh food at a reasonable price, who could ask for more.\\n\\nMy only complaint is that I had to return to Chicago and I am now craving to return to Papa J's.

The crust was great, the sauce wast too sweet and the toppings were sufficient. \\n\\nOur friend for the baby clams with oil and garlic over angel hair and let me try a bit - as good as the pizza was, this was _much_ better. \\n\\nWe'll return again to this beautifully lit gem in Carnegie PA soon!\"],\n",

       "  u\"OK, its Friday night and have about 70 minutes to eat. Driving by Papa J's and W says, lets stop in and get a quick dinner. \\n\\nAdvice host that we are in a hurry.  The host advised us it is a 90 minute service. The place was crowded, we were seated at the last open table. However our waiter, Jason, said he will do his best to get as out on time. We ordered our dinner immediately, with a salad and a glass of wine. In a few minutes we had our wine, then in a few more seconds we had our salads and some great homemade Italian bread with some olive oil and balsamic ving. for dipping.  Yum!\\n\\nJust as we were finishing our salads our dinners were delivered. Great job Jason! The Fettuccine Carbanara was very good; a thick cream sauce with bacon and ricotta.  In and out in 60 minutes.  Now that is some good service.\"],\n",

       "  u'I have to say that I write this review with much regret, because I have always loved PaPa J\\'s. But my recent experience there has changed my mind a bit. \\n\\nFrom the minute we were seated, we were greeted by a server that was clearly inexperienced and didn\\'t know the menu. As I said before, I\\'ve been to PaPa J\\'s a good handful of times so I know the menu decently well, but the server couldn\\'t explain any of the questions I had about a couple new dishes I was thinking about trying. I swear this guy must have just looked at the menu for the first time a few minutes ago.\\n\\nBut it wasn\\'t just the knowledge of the menu. It was one thing after another with our server. My wife asked for a glass of water 4 times until she finally got it (at which point the meal was over, so we didn\\'t care at that point).  I mean come on, for a restaurant of this calibre and price is it too much to ask for a glass of water? There was no one filling up water.\\n\\nMy biggest complaint, however, is what happened with our meals. My dad and I both ordered the trout special (trout with roasted red peppers and lump crabmeat). Instead, the meal that was delivered to both of us was trout with a heaping pile of spinach and mushrooms. Not what the special was at all.  And by the way, that item is on the menu as a regular item so whether or not the mistake was made by the server (which, we are sure it was) or the chef, who knows for certain. Not to mention, though, that a good server wouldn\\'t have served us that regardless. \\n\\nBut before you think we had an unusal experience that was all due to a poor server, let me continue. When we informed our server of the mistake, he didn\\'t really believe us until he checked his order sheet, and then he blamed the error on the chef. At this point, the meal had been sitting (because it took us forever to flag this guy down again) so the trout was basically cold. The server then said he would have the meals re-made. So, he took the meals back to the kitchen. Meanwhile, of course, my wife and mom are eating their meals and my dad and I are sitting there with no meals. Also keep in mind that my wife still had not gotten the water she had been asking for, and my iced tea had been refilled with a soda (yes, believe that or not). All the kitchen did was scrape their \"mistake\" off of our fish! They didn\\'t remake anything. Our fish was served to us again with little pieces of spinach and mushrooms sticking all over it. Quite frankly, the fish wasn\\'t good at all. I honestly would have rather had a fish sandwich from McDonald\\'s that night. The server never did anything to try to make our experience better - he knew we weren\\'t happy, but never offered anything such as dessert on the house. I\\'m not looking for a handout, but our experience was just plain awful that night. The guy never really even apologized for the mistake. Normally, I may have asked for a manager, but at this point I was ready to just get out of there (plus, we had to be somewhere else that night).\\n\\nMy opinion... for the money, there are many other restaurants I would rather eat at.'],\n",

       "  u'This is a regular go-to for me. I love the food and the service. They always have the wine that I like and the food is always delicious.

It is sublime and makes you want to go to a special cozy corner just to eat it and revel in its velvety loveliness.'],\n",

Instead of it being served on a hoagie, it was served on thin bread- like focaccia or something.  It was pretty good- little messy.\\n\\nThe desserts looked amazing.

       "  u\"Great place for dinner, drinks or a small celebration.\\n\\nPapa J's is one of my favorite go to places for dinner when we don't have reservations and want a nice dinner out. My husband and I have eatten here upwards of 20 times over the last few years and have never been disappointed. I assumed that when they opened the alternate bar with lounge area and extra tables for dining on the other side of the resturant that  the overall vibe of the restaurant would change and it would be very busy. I have been proved wrong.  We are always able to walk in on a weekend and get a table within a few minutes. Unfortunately, the alternate bar/lounge area isn't always open. I really don't understand why more people don't go here. \\nMy favorites are the fried zucchini, wedding soup and pizza.The zucchini is always crispy and seasoned well. The wedding soup has big chunks of carrots and celery. My husband also enjoys the pork entrees especially the grilled pork and the pastas including the tomato cream sauce. Also, their homemade italian bread with oil and vinegar to dip is a great way to wet your appetite. Make sure to add the parmesan cheese that they put on the table. \\n\\nAlso, if you are looking for a good place to host a birthday party or event, consider Papa Js. They have a great catering menu and are easily able to accomodate larger parties. We had our rehersal dinner for our wedding here and everyone loved the food.\"],\n",

       "  u'Although the first impression through the door is charming and the aroma enticing  as you enter this restaurant- much can be improved upon for the prices asked for the dining experience. Our group of 7 had called a week ahead and were seated in the back of the far dining room, right by a door where clinking pots /pans and  dishes were heard throughout our meal, as well as a Darth Vader type noise coming from the ceiling vent. Our waitress was not knowledgable of all menu items, and three of our  very simple requests did not come out as ordered. ( dressing on the side of a salad,  less feta on an entree and no oil on another entree) The waitress blamed it on the cook, but did offer to get one entree changed. Also we were asked if we wanted pine nuts, feta or Gorgonzola on our salad and then were charged 2.00 extra per item in addition to the salad price (6.99) which brought the salad up to 10.99 ! Outrageous !\\nThere is so much possibility for ambiance in this restaurant , but they miss the mark on service and atmosphere. I will most likely not return.

It made no sense, how could we order when the waitress wasn't coming to the table? After arguing with me he ended up taking $6 off of our $200+ bill. Ridiculous. If it were up to me I would have never returned. Unfortunately my family decided to go here again tonight. Again it took a long time to get our food. My food was cold and bland, my kids food was cold. My husbands salmon was burnt to a crisp and my sister in law took one bite of her trout and refused to eat any more because she claims it was so disgusting. The wedding soup and bread were good, but that's it! My drink sat empty throughout my meal and never got refilled even when I asked. Bad food, slow service and rude managers.

One member of our party walked up to the bar to let them know we were sitting on the couches along the wall, as it was fairly busy that night. In the short time that he was there, a man who was behind the bar looked at him and then turn away without saying a word or notifying anyone else. He then turned to a waitress who had approached the service area of the bar and asked her if  we could have a server take our drink order. She said \"yep\" and then abruptly turned and walked away. At that point, he asked to see the manager  who came a few minutes later. When my friend told him of what had occurred, the manager said \"What do you want me to do\"?\\n\\nMy friend said \"An apology would be a good start\" whereupon the manager looked back at him and said \"Get out and don\\'t come back\" ???????? Are you kidding????\\n\\nMy friend is well traveled and frequently stays at higher end hotels and dines at quality restaurants. He was not screaming or belligerent in any way, shape, or form; simply informing the manager of what had occurred. \\n\\nThat being said, we left and went back to 131 East, where we had previously eaten. The service there was fabulous, as was the meal and the drinks creative and exquisite.\\n\\nThere are new restaurants that have opened in Carnegie as of late. Papa J\\'s is no longer the only game in town.  Obviously this is the way a simple complaint is handled by management. Appalling!!

My pesto pasta had no flavor (did not taste like a cream sauce to me) & the pesto was so runny/watery & way too much sauce not enough noodles. My husband's pasta had even less flavor than mine. We ate about a quarter of the food & couldn't even finish it. We took it home & it was so bad I didn't even eat my leftovers. And I hate wasting food!!

       "  u'I struggle to write this review simply because this dining experience confused me. First, the restaurant itself is on a convenient corner st in downtown Carnegie\\'s main street. When you walk in you the first thing you see is a counter filled with desserts and amazing looking house made breads. It rather looks like a deli counter. You have to walk around to get to the hostess station and then can go left to the bar or right to the dining area. A bit confusing layout, but tastefully done. The dining area is brighter than the rest of the restaurant. It felt much more upscale once in the dining area, but I did find the overall restaurant tastefully unique. \\n\\nThe food - A wide range of Italian dishes and seafood. We ordered the crab hozel as an appetizer. It was an average serving of lump crab meat, I had to ask for cocktail sauce. It was tasty, but cost us $18. We then ordered the veal and shrimp entree with sauteed veggies like artichokes, eggplant, peppers, etc. There were 4 smaller sized cutlets of veal and 3 shrimp. $28. There was no salad or pasta side offered. The dish was prepared properly and was OK. We just felt it needed something else. \\n\\nNow the bread that was offered to our table came in a small basket and was filled with a variety of their house made breads. The pepperoni bread was AMAZING! I mean really delish. This alone I would have given 5 stars. \\n\\nThe service - Our server was...well....I\\'m not sure what he was quite frankly. Annoying?Confused? Hyper?  He appeared to have no idea what he was doing half the time. Bouncing around the table, asking the same questions over and over, forgetful, spastic, etc. At one point one of my colleagues said, \"Is he on crack?\" We chuckled, but seriously! He forgot to even ask us if we wanted dessert, which was too bad because we saw some amazing looking offerings in the cases as we were leaving.\\n\\nOverall - If I were in the area again I would definitely stop in to get some pepperoni bread to go, as they do sell it by the loaves. However, I think I would try somewhere else to dine.'],\n",

       "  u\"Did dinner with my GF last Saturday at PaPa J's prior to going to the Off The Wall Theater. This was the first time we've been to this restaurant. We usually stop a Riley's Pour House across the street for a bite before seeing a show in this town but today we decided to shake it up and do something different.\\n\\nThe place is deceptively larger than it looks from the outside. It was also busier than we would have expected on this particular evening and we got one of the remaining tables which was located near the entrance and the bar. The traffic from both the customers and the staff that flowed past us was a little noisy and distracting and we could tell that's why it was one of the last tables available. But our waitress came by promptly, got us drinks (I had a Hoegaarden and my girl ordered an Absolute water and cranberry), gave us menus and recited the specials of the day.\\n\\nAfter viewing the menu for a bit, I decided on the Veal Parmigiano; my date went with one of the specials, a chicken and broccoli gnocchi dish. The plates took about 15 minutes to arrive and the portions were humongous... enough for a filling lunch the next day. My veal was tender and delicious but it's really the gnocchi that left the biggest impression. You could tell that it was house made; it was like little fluffy pillows dissolving in your mouth with each bite. I never tasted gnocchi like it before.\\n\\nOver all I give PaPa J's a big thumbs up. The food was good, most of the dinning area's seemed cozy, the building itself has a certain charm with its high ceiling and the tables draped in white table cloths give it a pristine appearance. Although I thought it was a bit pricy, I didn't feel as if I've been taken.  Other than the location of our table, it was the pre-theater perfect meal. I only hope get a more intimate table next time we stop for dinner.\"],\n",

We were seated in the bar area by the sidewalk, which is what we requested because of the great weather and the happy hour specials. Our server took our order of a gingerale, fried zucchini appetizer, side salad, wedding soup , eggplant rolotini and chicken piccata ( correct spelling).\\n\\nWe thoroughly enjoyed the bread & wedding soup.\\nThe side salad was rather bland and unexciting, lacking flavor & texture. The Spring salad consisted of leaf lettuce, a single slice of tomato and one black olive. I would have expected some additions such as onions, peppers, cheese, cucumbers, croutons, carrots and the like.\\n \\n  We enjoyed the fresh air while waiting for our appetizer, but were growing concerned that it would arrive too close to the meal, so we asked the server ( bartender ) about the appetizer and he told us that he had forgot to \"put it in\". He offered to put it in at this point, but advised us that our meals would be out soon. We decided to just wait for our meals and forgo the appetizer which were looking forward to. \\n \\n  The main dishes were acceptable, not outstanding. The eggplant was very tasty and well prepared.  The Chicken Piccata was flavorful, but not as expected.\\nThe chicken seemed to have been steamed or baked. It had no signs of being coated and saut\\xe9ed  to a rich golden brown. The chicken was just pale white.\\nThe sauce was a simple lemon flavor, it lacked any depth that would have resulted from the browning of the chicken. I tasted no garlic or shallots. The sauce lacked that famous tang usually supplied by capers, which were absent.  No pasta was served with the chicken. The side of vegetables were well cooked, buy again lacked any real flavor. The would have benefited from a roasting which would have produced a rich savory taste produced by extraction of the natural sugars.\\n\\n  Once our meals were finished  our plates were taken and we waited another 20 minutes for the check. The server seemed more concerned with what was on television rather than his customers. The total was $43 and change.\\nI would have expected the salad and soup would have been removed from the bill for the error of not putting in our appetizer order, but no such offer was made and \\nI saw no manager come around and check on the customers, as is customary.\\nI am hesitant to go back to this restaurant or  recommend it to anyone after tonights dining experience.

       "  u'Stopped in for lunch after I got lost due to construction in the area. Was trying to go to a different place. Glad the Pizza Gods were looking out for me. Ordered a caesar salad with anchovies and a large pizza with sausage and mushrooms. The salad was fresh and excellent. Dressing was made fresh and the anchovies were top notch. There is a wide variety of anchovies when it comes to quality and they use excellent ones. There was also plenty of them as usually you get a sparse amount. The large salad was more that enough for my wife and I. They serve a bread basket with two styles of bread. Pepper cheese and a standard Italian with a harder crust. They were both so good I purchased a loaf of each on the way out. Price per loaf was only $4. No way they make profit on the Pepper Cheese Loaf. Best value in bread in quite some time. I will stop in for the bread whenever I am in the area. The Pepper Cheese I would rate a 9.5 out of 10. The Italian was as good as it gets. I am a Pizza snob and getting a good review from me is tough. I am so tough I do not review if I think its bad. There Pizza is excellent and I would recommend it to anyone remotely close to the place. I would ask for a little less sauce. I would call it almost NY Style. Slightly thicker crust. I asked the waiter if I should order it well done and he said order it as is. He was correct and it came out perfect.   The waiter and staff were excellent and they informed me that they do not even own a microwave.'],\n",

The store feels cluttered because there is so much stuff everywhere. However, if you're looking for something specific, good luck.

One stall was already taken, so two of us are stuck waiting while this occupant does her....shall we say, business? After a few seconds, we realize that she\\'s not only there to relieve herself, but to also take drive-through orders. Yes, that\\'s right....\"You want fries with that? *flush* Okay, that will be $5.50\". I have never, ever witnessed anything so insane as a drive-through restroom. To top it off, after finishing her \"bathroom break\", she walks straight out of the stall and into the restaurant. I guess she was in too much of a rush to complete the order she had just taken that she didn\\'t have time to wash her hands. And I was in too much of a rush to choke back up what I had just eaten before it wreaked mayhem on my stomach.'],\n",

It just hit the spot!\\n\\nI was impressed by our waiter as soon as we walked through the door. He apologized for our very brief wait to be seated and for the fact that he was the only waiter working at that time. However, everything was delivered promptly, and he made what would've been just a tasty diner dinner into a great experience.\\n\\nI ordered a grilled cheese and fries. The grilled cheese was well cooked and filled with tasty, perfectly melty cheese. I love Steak 'n Shake's thin and crispy fries, and these were as delicious as I had expected.\\n\\nFor just $9 for me and my husband, I have to admit that we had forgotten how inexpensive Steak 'n Shake was.

So I then went on to tell her what I wanted on my burger. Pulled around and got my order pretty quick, but later when I open my burger its just meat and cheese. The meat is badly burned and cold.

I don't know how corporate keeps this place open. I've complained numerous times but it never does any good.\\n\\nTake the extra 20 minutes to drive to the South Hills location.

The dresses on the second floor usually range from $30-60 and are good for over a year.

       "  u\"Well, the experience did not start well. When we walked in the singing we heard was NOT good. Oy was it not good... Thankfully, it (mostly) improved from there.\\n\\nSo there were 3 piano players rotating out on a half hour basis. So each was on for an hour and off for half. Of the 3, two were really good. Good singers, good piano players, and very funny. The third guy, well, not so much. Piano skills were fine. But his singing was not. When he sang in his range, he wasn't too bad actually, but too often he reached for notes that he couldn't get to or forced things that just weren't going to happen. Often his jokes fell completely flat. Luckily the other two usually did most the talking.\\n\\nThey played a variety of songs as requested by the crowd and would do them in unconventional styles if requested (Closer by NIN as sung by a lounge singer was a highlight). We requested Britney Spears' Toxic cause we thought it would be funny and so they gave it a shot and as luck would have it, it turned out REALLY good. That takes some serious talent to pull off. If they didn't know it (like Toxic) they'd find it and play it. They played a wide variety of stuff.\\n\\nPart of the experience is based on the crowd. We had a couple larger groups (there on a Thursday night, so smallish group in general) that they interacted with a lot, providing some running jokes and comedy. Of course, that also meant some annoying drunk people feeling like they could take over half the show.\\n\\nMy friends were BIG fans of the super cheap beer specials. $1 drafts from Rock Bottom next door. The waitress wasn't great but it could have been that she was the only one there and the layout isn't that easy to navigate. The bar was generally uncrowded though so getting service there was fast.\\n\\nIf in the Waterfront for a night out, definitely a place to hit and have some fun if you are up for some fun and willing to sit through a couple clunkers of songs/jokes. Having a fun loving group of friends to mock things with when they go off the rails a bit will help make it more fun.\"],\n",

       "  u'While we were in Pittsburgh for the Winter Classic on New Years Day, we figured we\\'d see what the area had to offer for NYE. My wife and I, along with my friend and his girlfriend hit up Sing Sing in Homestead. It\\'s apparently located on what was the site of one of the largest steel mills in the area. When it closed they turned the entire site into a large outdoor shopping and entertainment development. The only remaining artifacts from what once was, were the nine or so original mill smoke stacks still standing at the primary entrance. Pretty cool.\\n\\nSing Sing, which is a piano bar, is attached to the Rock Bottom Brewery and serves a selection of RBB\\'s in-house brews and shares a similar menu. There are no TV\\'s, no sports memorabilia (which is rare for this city), and no big booths for large groups. This place is all about being a cabaret with the focus on the musicians. Mind you this isn\\'t a bad thing, just note that if you want a bar, go next door or across the street to Dave and Busters. I\\'d say Sing Sing holds about 150 people seated.\\n\\nThis particular night they were hosting a (shocker) NYE\\'s party. For $40 bucks a person you got a choice of two entrees (beef tenderloin tips or lemon chicken), veggies, mashed potatoes, one free drink coupon, a midnight champagne toast, and, what turned out to be over four hours of non-stop music. Again... Pretty Cool.\\n\\nThere were three musicians holding down the fort playing more than just piano (drums, electric synth, bass guitar, and apparently I missed the sax). There was plenty of crowd involvement. As in most piano bars you request songs along with a tip. The larger the tip, the better chance of hearing your song you have. I put three requests on a sheet with a 10 and managed to get two played. Their rendition of Toto\\'s Africa was fantastic and surprisingly, my curve ball got hit out of the park when one of the guys actually knew the tune and words to the Theme from TV\\'s \"Growing Pains.\" I was sold from that point on.\\n\\nI will take this time to note that this is NOT a family friendly joint. I\\'m not sure if it was 21+ only but I certainly wouldn\\'t bring anyone too young to drive. A good amount of sexual refrences and strong language awaits you.\\n\\nDrinks were stiff and not horribly overpriced. I think rail mixed drinks were $7.00 and beers were 6 or so (RBB doesn\\'t brew anything I particularly enjoy so I stuck with rum and cokes). All and all my bill wasn\\'t scary and I\\'m not used to that on Dec 31st. Waitress staff was really nice and incredibly attentive. No complaints there. \\n\\nThe only down side to everything was group seating as you\\'re sitting at 2-top cab tables. It was easily fixed though as the group next to us was up for rearranging tables from side to side to front to back (allowing us to talk and share food/booze etc), also, being a tourist, we had no idea how hard it would be to get a cab in Homestead. Understandably NYE has its issues with cab availability but we had to wait 2.5 hours for a cab because, as we found out, Homestead is a very suburban community right outside of the city and everyone drives. \\n\\nOoops!\\n\\nAll and all a good time and someplace I\\'d certainly return to if for any reason I\\'d be back in Pittsburgh... as long as I have a car.'],\n",

       "  u\"In my opinion, Sing Sing is really not worth it. It gets expensive because you drink, maybe start to sing a few lyrics, drink some more, think of a song you wanna hear, put $5 and title of said song on a piece of paper, you drink, they play it, everyone else is trying to get their songs played so you put $10 on your next sticky note...and so on and so forth. I wasn't really into it when I first got there but as the night went on and lager went in I started to warm up to the place. I feel that if I have to drink in order to have a good time, it's not worth it.

But you do pay for the whole experience....so you gotta get into the spirit with some spirits! \\n\\nThe guys who play are incredibly talented. There's 2 guys that will take requests and play songs on the piano. They pretty much play ANYTHING you ask. Contemporary songs, throw back songs, fight songs, rap songs, pop songs. You name it, they play it. \\n\\nMy favorite part is when they switch out to another two guys. They'll all four get on stage and play two piano's, a guitar and drums.

Crowd is an important component of a piano bar due to the interactive nature of it all.  I was there last Saturday night (8/4/12) and there was about 20-30 people there.  Very slow and boring.  It appears the crowd is no longer allowed up on stage, taking a lot of the interactive fun out of what this place used to be.  This was likely my last time at Sing Sing.

       "  u'My friend is a piano teacher, so I took it as a good sign that Sing Sing would be quality stuff. It was her birthday, and I didn\\'t really know anything about dueling piano bars. I was picturing glossy black grand pianos with glittering notes, pianists in black jackets and crystal glasses full of red wine. I am really, really glad I was wrong. \\n\\nIt was gritty, bawdy and quintessentially Pittsburgh. First off, the pianos are scuffed to hell, considering the number of tipsy people who sit on them nightly while being mildly humiliated. The musicians hammer away at them, and they\\'re covered with N@ and Sing Sing stickers. It\\'s obvious they\\'ve been well-loved. The music is anything but the elevator music I was picturing; it\\'s rock, hip-hop, oldies, pop, and just about any genre imaginable thanks to the request system (send up a piece of paper with some money) and the amazing repertoire of the musicians. For instance, \"Rubber Ducky\" and \"Gangsta\\'s Paradise\" were both featured when I was there, and both performed impeccably. They also honored a request for a Taylor Swift song only to receive $30 and a request for \"anything else,\" which they promptly followed. The musicians also do funny versions of popular songs, and throw in things like \"yinz\" instead of \"you.\"\\n\\nI saw in awe of the performers for a decent portion of the night. It must take a particularly special type of person to put on a show like this, considering the energy, confidence, wit, empathy, boldness, silliness, cleverness, and sheer talent a job like this requires. They rotate performers in and out so there\\'s not even an intermission. I\\'ve read comments about the baseness of the humor, but I had no doubt the guys up on stage were intelligent dudes. They had great personalities: one was about 140 pounds, cheeky, and quick-witted. He acted out every sport in the winter olympics, and was pretty into this 90-something-year-old lady in the audience called Joan. The other had crazy hair and bright blue Chucks, beatboxed as well as he sang, and made it point to play a handful of songs for my friend\\'s birthday. \"I think Ray Charles is the most soulful guy of all time,\" he said when she requested him.\\n\\nThere were tons of people celebrating birthdays, and one big bachelorette party the Saturday night I was there. The performers bring the birthday boy/girl, bachelor/bachelorette, etc. on stage (for a $20 tip, which is pretty easy to scrounge up among friends) and humiliate the hell out of them, i.e. this is not the place to be if you can\\'t laugh at yourself. My friend had a short dress on when she sat on the piano, and they sang a three-minute song about her vagina.\\n\\nLuckily, the show eclipsed the bad service and overpriced, weak drinks, because those did feature heavily throughout the night. The rest of the staff was friendly, however, and I stumbled on the door guy singing and dancing by himself, which made me smile.\\n\\nSing Sing is definitely not an every weekend type of thing (much like Hofbr\\xe4uhaus), but is a splendid way to celebrate a special occasion.

If you don't have a reservation and/or come later in the evening, it's difficult to get seats.

By a half hour later, we still had not received the buffalo chicken tenders, nor the French onion soup (which should have been mostly made already), and no fries.  We were told the chef was new, but no effort was made really to make the situation better. No quick and easy app or beers on the house. To boot, the beer was pretty expensive.

I've had three different, but equally simple, dishes there; A Burger, a Cheesesteak and Chicken Tenders. The first was flavorless and cold. The second was passable, but nothing special.

       "  u\"We came here on a Saturday night and luckily it wasn't as packed as I thought it would be. I love playing ticket games so luckily there were a lot of games to chose from and not many video games (sorry video game lovers!) We only played $20 worth of games and surprisingly we were there for awhile. I love their new Wheel of Fortune game! On our first play, we ended up winning a little over 700 tickets! They also have Fruit Ninja as a game. It was fun with the big widescreen but unfortunately you don't win as many tickets as you would hope. I wish their ticket center would have individual ticket counters like the other D&B's I've been to, where you feed a counting machine your tickets. At this place, they just weigh your tickets and give you the final count. We didn't try the food here and instead went to P.F. Chang's to eat before coming here, but the Eat & Play deal looked fun. Too bad it was only restricted to certain times of the day. Overall I had a blast here and definitely would come back. Hopefully next time when there is a deal or promotion.\"],\n",

       "  u\"When did Dave and Buster's become a daycare?? Everywhere you look, there are signs that say kids must be accompanied by an adult, but apparently no one was honoring that at 6PM on a Saturday. I couldn't even walk through the place without someone shoving me. AHHH!\\nI get that Dave and Buster's is an arcade and that you're going there to play some games, maybe eat, and kill some time. When I last went there a few years ago, we there for my bachelor party, and while I'm sure we got into some shenanigans, I don't remember children running wild there. We were having adult beverages, playing games, and having a good time. This time, it was ridiculous. It isn't Chuck E. Cheese, yet that's how parents seem to be treating the place.\\nOn top of that, the customer service sucked. The place is gigantic, with tables and serving areas everywhere, yet on a Saturday at 6PM, the hostess told us (after interrupting us three times to chat with the other hostess) told us it would be a three hour wait, despite the fact that there were empty tables all over the dining room. I suspect this is a ploy to get you to play games and spend money until you're table is ready, but the food at Dave and Buster's is not worth a three hour wait on any day.\\nThe hostess told us we could be served right away if we went to the midway and found an empty table, so we attempted that. Most of those tables were empty with usually one or two adults at a giant empty table filled with coats who informed us that they needed the table because their kids would be back soon after playing games. Next, i engaged in the most rudest thing I've ever done- I began stalking tables where people were finishing up. I would walk up to people paying their check, ask if I could have their table when they were done, and they would inform me that there were already two or three people who asked them and I should get in line.\\nFinally, we found a table and proceeded to spend two hours eating dinner. It wasn't because we ordered a lot of food- it was that the waiter took forever to bring our food out. He seemed to have no problem getting us fresh drinks, until we drank as much as we could and then asked for water. After that, he seemed to come around a lot less. \\nI had the build your own chicken tacos, which comes on a giant plate with all kinds of fixings. The fixings were fresh, but the chicken was cold and dry, and the tortillas were dried out as well. For $14, it wasn't worth it. \\nAfter dinner we proceeded to play games, which entails shoving people to get through areas and waiting in line to play anything. \\nAll in all, I didn't like my experience at Dave and Busters. I remembered it being a fun place to go and unwind as an adult. but between all the kids and the crappy service, can't recommend this place. If anyone asks me to go back, I may elect to stay home and poke my eyes with a fork.\"],\n",

The place was far from crowded, and when a machine was out of tickets, it took us a good deal of time to find someone to assist us. When we did, the team at D&B could not have been more accommodating. To apologize for our wait they swiped us in for several games as well as gave us a handful of tokens for the game we were playing. \\n\\nI think a lot of companies (I'm looking at you, American Airlines) could learn a lot from D&B. It cost them virtually nothing to swipe us in for games, but it made our experience so much better.\\n\\nDrinks are half-price after 8 or 9, my Tropical Mojito was awesome!

I haven\\'t been to this Dave and Buster\\'s since I was younger and was ready to go back and play me some games! I went with my cousins, mind you, we hadn\\'t ate all day and were very hungry. So, we decided to do the Eat & Play Combo, naturally. Here\\'s where it gets bad. First of all, we get a very snobby hostess that shows us to our table. Then, we wait...and wait...and finally after about 25 mins we get a waitress. Her name was Ashley. We had plenty of time to decide what we wanted, so we quickly put our order in. Next, we were sitting and talking, waiting, we had empty glasses and our waitress had never even come around to see if we needed refills except for one time. She said she\\'d come back right away with our refills...yea, right. 20 mins later we get our refills. Mind you, our food still hasn\\'t came yet. I see other people getting their food that had come in after us. I was frustrated. After waiting 45 mins for our food, I asked to speak with a manager. One of the servers who I asked replied rudely with \"Well, he\\'s really busy right now. I doubt he\\'ll be able to come out and talk to you\". Finally, 15 mins later...that\\'s one hour, folks. We get our food. What do you think the next problem was? Yep, the food was cold. I was completely fed up at this point, and told my waitress how disappointed I was, especially after driving one hour just to have this terrible service. The manager never came to speak with me, and we didn\\'t even receive our meals for free. The only compensation we got were $10 game cards. Woopty-doo. The only thing good about this place is the games, but the prizes you get for your tickets are all junk and worthless. So, in conclusion...I DO NOT RECOMMEND THE WATERFRONT DAVE AND BUSTERS OF HOMESTEAD, PA. It was horrible, and I will not be returning for a very long time!'],\n",

When we arrived we were greeted by a long line of people waiting to buy game cards. At first there were 2 extremely slow workers trying to do this, then one left while the line was still out the door! The girl that was left was more than incompetent, and was taking extremely long to fill these game cards. We stood in line for over 20 minutes before being told that there was another attendant in the actual game room. Needless to say, the line in the game room was just as long, and they still only had one girl in the booth. It was a Saturday! After we finally got our cards we had to wait yet again to get a beer. 2 bartenders on staff while the bar was completely full. It took us almost an hour before we actually could start gaming. The floors were filthy with trash, and the bathrooms: repulsive! I had to use the restrooms twice during our visit, and not only did both bathrooms I used have no toilet paper in them, but there was TP all over the floors, and the sinks were less than cleanly. My boyfriend mentioned that the guys restroom was no better, as it smelled like pee and the paper towel dispenser didn't work. All I have to say is get your crap together. We could see a difference in the type of crowed that was there on Saturday compared to what it used to be, and I'm I have no doubt it's due to the poor service and attention to cleanliness. For how expensive they are they need to staff better on weekends. It's a shame how quickly this place has gone down hill and we will NOT be returning anytime soon!\"],\n",

       "  u'Dave & Busters is a great experience  if you set your expectations realistically and carefully choose when you attend.\\n\\nThe main squeeze and I always 1) use a survey receipt for buy $10 get $10 in free gameplay or 2) Attend on a Wednesday during the day (flexible work schedules). We\\'d never dream of eating there because we like healthy yuppie food. And we only drink cheap drafts OR drink cocktails during happy hour.\\n\\nYour visit is largely determined by time of day, expectations and whether or not you eat their food. If you come on a Friday night, the lines will be long. You\\'ll pay $150 for the two of you to eat, drink and play for 3 hours and you\\'ll be left with a very sour taste in your mouth.\\n\\nThe staff is really excellent; any issue with a game not paying out tickets results in immediate help and extra tickets or a swipe for a different game from an employee. \\n\\nNote the \"drinks are weak\" reviews. Also notice it was people buying shots and ordering multiple drinks per person. That\\'s typical white trash behavior. Bartenders here are savvy; they mirror the behavior of the guests. All of our drinks have been consistently strong and well put together because we\\'re courteous and tip well. I have witnessed bartenders bypass tattooed, loud guests and address me and take my order first. This is rational, logical behavior. \\n\\nAlso note the \"prize center games suck\" comments. You\\'re supposed to stack tickets over multiple visits and use them on a big prize. Like life, delaying gratification nets you bigger returns. Every other visit I\\'ve seen someone walk out with a video game system (Wii, Xbox360 and even a few Xbox One\\'s). \\n\\nThe thing about Dave & Busters is the crowd changes depending on day of week and time of day. Sunday afternoon it\\'s all families and Friday and Saturday night it\\'s all drunk 20 somethings. The atmosphere changes and that\\'s why the reviews are all over the place.\\n\\nThis review is based on 8ish months of 1-3/monthly visits.

After seeing the enticing commercials so many times, we decided to give this place a try on a double date. I understand the prices of the play cards and won't dispute them; however, the food was incredibly over-priced, came out COLD (as in, sat on a counter without warmers for a minimum of 30 minutes) and I literally had to ask the bartender if there was any vodka in my drink. It was pure juice. $38 for three shots that had little-no alcohol in them. (Not to mention, my glass was dirty, and I saw the bartender scoop the glass into the ice basin because she was too lazy to use the sanitary scoop. I know the Food and Beverage Commission would be as disappointed as I was.) The service was terrible. Don't ask for anything from your waiter, as they are a little too busy on their cell phones or conversing amongst themselves. \\n\\nWas it fun to be in an adult-themed arcade? Yes. If you're looking for a good atmosphere to go with friends to play games, I suppose I would advise you give it a shot. I would never recommend their food, customer service, or drinks.

Pgh Happy Hour is a facebook group of friends that like to check out new 'watering holes' every thursday and it's run by a guy that seems to party 24/7 while still holding down a very lucrative full time job.  \\n\\nAnyway- Pgh HH was celebrating an anniversary and chose D&B for the location.  The D&B staff set up the back 'pool room' with complimentary,  enormous spread of appetizers with dips and kept refilling them when they got low.  Our server, Carla, was very attentive and friendly- making sure we were aware of the specials and checking back often when our glasses got to the half way point.  The other server back there was working equally as hard but I never got the chance to get her name.  \\n\\nI had been here one other time for an organized happy hour for a past employer and remember very similar service but I never got the chance to give them any credit.  I think D&B is an awesome place when you need some space for your next event.\"],\n",

       "  u'Ok! Let me tell you about my bad experience first. I went to D&B last night for a post wedding party - which, side note, is a great idea!\\n\\nIt was around midnight and the bar wasn\\'t really populated. There were three bartenders and only one was actually making rounds to see if anyone needed anything. The two other bartenders were chatting on the far side of the bar that no one was sitting at. Kind of counter productive if you ask me. \\n\\nI stood there for about 5 minutes, which for a busy bar is fine but when I am the only one with my card out then, it just seems a little ridiculous. I made eye contact with the one girl twice and gave her a smile and she literally turned away. I finally had to walk to them to get their attention.  I was standing right in front of them smiling and they didn\\'t ask if i need anything. I finally said, \"Are you working?\" and they gave each other a weird look. I felt like i was the crazy one. I asked for a beer/got the beer.\\n\\nIn between that time, the other bartender brought food over and set it down. She took a fry from the plate (right in front of me) and then served it to someone on the other side of the bar. What the hell! I felt like i was in some grimy bar in out in the sticks - not an established D&B. \\n\\nI was just really turned off from that experience. \\n\\nThe good is that D&B provides a different type of entertainment when you want to mix things up. I remember going here with my grandparents when I was a kid and it was the best treat ever! We would eat at the restaurant and then spend hours playing games. This place holds some really good memories for me. \\n\\nIt\\'s a shame that my experience last night has spoiled the high standards I held for it.'],\n",

The atmosphere is okay but it used to be so much better with the funnest games and diverse groups of people! Now, it is run down and many of the games are app related games (Fruit Ninja) and 3D Experience rides. With such \"games\", you can\\'t even earn tickets and they take a lot of tokens! Last time I went, back in the winter, many of the games were broken, which made for a negative player experience. I would go to D&B to play some games again in the future, but it is no longer one of my favorite places to go due to the decline of fun games where you can earn tickets.'],\n",

We ordered and got our drinks and well let's just say we didn't see the waitress again until she was giving us our check (some manager delivered the food to the table).

Last I overhead they are heading to the hospital. I'm not writing this message to be spiteful, I'm writing it in hopes that the future of your restaurant will improve.

       "  u\"Can we get a maintenance man?  And a janitor?  And a manager?   No?  Ok...\\n\\nI had a good time at Dave and Buster's, but that was based mainly on the company I kept and not the venue.   We went right when they opened for the day, with the intention of playing some pool.  We located the pool tables in an area that looked closed off, so we went to the hostess stand to ask.  She radioed for help, got none, and finally went in search of an answer our question.  When she came back, she said she couldn't find anyone, but a manager would be out to talk to us.   We wait...and wait...and finally just give up and go off to play in the arcade area.   \\n\\nAll but one of the card purchase machines were rebooting, and the one we could use didn't work.  It takes forever and finally gives up and directs us to a non-existent ticketing attendant.  So we again go off in search of someone to help.  We flagged down a server, who issued us a card ($56 for 375 tokens) and served us a few cocktails (average prices, though my rum and coke was teeny).   \\n\\nAnd we are off to play some games.  About every third game we tried was broken in some way.  Either the token swipe didn't work or the game itself was messed up.   It also wasn't the cleanest place I've ever seen.  They have tables around the place to set your drinks on, but most of them didn't look as though they'd been wiped from the day before (which of course makes we wonder when they last cleaned all the games that germy little kids touch all day).\\n\\nOverall, they appeared completely unprepared for opening (computers booting, employees not ready to work, soda gun at the bar not assembled, etc.) and not well maintained or managed at all.  The broken games were sort of comical after a while, but definitely not in a good way.  If you are really looking to do this type of activity, I'd try a different location for sure.\"],\n",

I came to the Homestead location last night eager to see the beer at this location.\\n\\nNow, Rockbottom is a chain brewery, so a lot was the same... the menu, the food prices (yet beer is cheaper, and I am fine with that). I have always found their food to be pricey, but they use excellent ingredients and it has always been tasty and filling so I am fine with that. The food here was just as good as the Long Beach location, so I have no problem with the chef at all.\\n\\nService was good, our waitress was very friendly and helpful. I wish that they had asked us if we wanted to sit in the bar since happy hour was still going, but that isn't a big thing. Went to the bar to get a drink and had to wait awhile to get the bartender's attention, but he was very friendly and I got a nice welcome from him and others at the bar when they learned I had just moved here... I really enjoyed that.\\n\\nBeer: We got the beer sampler to try the whole list... and, well... I found the dark beers a bit lacking in comparison. The light beer and the wheat were amazing, very impressed. The pale was ok, as was the velvet pale that was one of the specials of the night... but both were way too citrusy. The Uppity IPA was very good... I don't usually like IPAs because the hops overpowers all flavor but the brewer had a good balance. Still, couldn't do a whole glass. I felt the Imperial Stout had a bitter burned taste that was overpowering... I almost want to say the batch had too much chocolate malt in it (not ice cream malt, for the non-homebrewers). The brown and amber were decent, but bland. I ended up getting an actual glass of the light beer and was able to finish it all without forcing it.... one point up on Long Beach, who had a good light but the aftertaste got to you before the glass was empty.\\n\\nI REALLY wanted to try the Das Gut Dopplebock, but they were out. Looks like they will have it in bottles to go soon so I hope I can catch that. Also want to try the Snow Moon Belgian.\\n\\nVerdict: While I was not too impressed with the dark beers, I found the lighter ones very good and I look forward to trying the other seasonal beers. It is a good hour drive south to get there, so I won't be going too often, but I will be back.\"],\n",

       "  u\"So I have not been to one of these in awhile since I normally have an aversion to chain restaurants, but since I was with colleagues on travel for work and they chose this place I went along. \\n\\nFirst surprise: decent beer.  I remembered the normal RB Brewery beers were not much to write home about but they had a couple of new styles, including a very good imperial IPA that for $5/glass cannot be beat.  Second surprise: pretty tasty food with a lot more healthy options than I expected.  Recommend the summer salad and the ahi tuna - both were great. \\n\\nService was a little slow (not sure why) so a 4-star review is downgraded to 3.5. I'll be back next time I'm in Pittsburgh for work.\"],\n",

       "  u\"The beer is good. Their light beer, Lumpy Dog, is very good-- doesn't taste like a light beer. When I was pregnant I became quite a fan of their root beer floats, too.\\n\\nAs others have noted, the pretzels are really good. I'm not a fan of the spinach dip but my husband likes it. Veggie burgers are always good, too, though the staff sometimes seems confused when you order, say, the bourbonzola burger with a veggie burger. Long, long ago, when I used to go to the Rock Bottom in Boston, there was a hot mushroom / sundried tomato / cheese dip on the menu that was fantastic... if they resurrect that I will gladly add another star!\"],\n",

       "  u\"I always feel like I am constantly bashing breweries for their food, but in my opinion, I feel the bar is raised for places like this. It seems there are so many breweries out there that offer great beer, and slack off on the food. Unfortunately Rock Bottom is one that falls into that category. Let's be honest, when you go to a brewery, you want the full experience. If it was only about the beer, I'd go buy a growler and take it home. \\n\\nSo, about the beer....EXCELLENT!!!!! The Jagoff IPA is with out a doubt one of the best IPAs I have ever had! They only I can think of that I think is better is Dogfish Head, but that's a matter of opinion. The beer selection is constantly changing, and they always have some excellent seasonal beers. You can't go wrong, there's bound to be a beer everyone will like. \\n\\nAs for the food.......it's pretty much a crap shoot. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's terrible. My biggest problem is there is absolutely no consistency when it comes to the food. One time it's perfect, then maybe it's cold, or it's burned, or it tastes completely different from the last time you had it. Unfortunately, it seems there is zero attention to food quality. \\n\\nThat's pretty much it. This place fixes it's food consistency, and it's a five star place. Till then, it's hit or miss!\"],\n",

       "  u'I must admit, I do like the brews.  I also like the white cheddar mash potatoes.  Other than that, meh.  The food is pretty forgettable.  Another \"brewery\" that sadly fails to be anything special in the food department.  With the restaurants upping the ante on 8th Ave, you may want to kick it up a notch Rock Bottom.  But how would anyone know to?  It\\'s a chain.  Whomp whomp!'],\n",

       "  u'I\\'ve always been pleasantly surprised with the food I\\'ve gotten at Rock Bottom.  I say \"surprised\\' because with any restaurant that falls into the slippery territory of a \"chain\", you expect to find your fair share of culinary duds.  But I\\'ve really had a lot of good meals at Rock Bottom.  Now, granted, you do owe it to yourself when ordering to not forget where you are (a \"bar-straunt\" if you will), and don\\'t get anything above and beyond this place\\'s call of duty.  For instance, I will never be ordering the ahi tuna.  I\\'ll leave that to my favorite sushi bars and restaurants a bit closer to the water (the Mon doesn\\'t count.....).\\n\\nBut besides that, I always really enjoy my meal choices.  I\\'ve recently gotten the chicken avocado sandwich.  Chicken was grilled perfectly, plenty of avocado, and it was a good sized sandwich without being excessive.  I\\'ve also ordered the Margherita pizza, which could definitely be split between two people.  It\\'s an eight cut that comes to you on a big wooden pizza paddle.  The pizza was really great.  The crust was crispy, it had a good balance of cheese and tomatoes, and the basil pesto was fresh and tasty.  And not greasy whatsoever - BIG bonus points there.  But my biggest surprise as of late was when I ordered their chicken flautas.  I\\'m a HUGE Mexican food fan and always hesitate to order Mexican outside of a Mexican restaurant for fear of being disappointed.  But I had an insatiable craving one night and decided to go for it.  It was DELICIOUS.  The flautas are deep fried which gives you an amazing crunch, and they still managed to not dry out the inner ingredients.  The accompanying rice was nice and moist as well.  I was so happy!\\n\\nI\\'ve always been quite happy with the service there as well.  I go on Thursday evenings for trivia, and nine times out of ten the service is really spot on.  The ladies servicing the bar area are friendly and attentive.  Only once or twice, to my memory, has my service been sub-par, and that can usually be chalked up to an extremely packed Trivia Night with only two visible servers helping 50+ people.\\n\\nI definitely give Rock Bottom two thumbs up for taking your typical chain-found food and making it fresh, yummy, and worth coming back for more.'],\n",

       "  u'I went to Rock Bottom this past weekend, and it was \"nice\" to see that nothing has changed in the year or two since my last visit. While the beer is pretty good, it has never outweighed the fact that the service isn\\'t good and the food is average, at best.\\n\\nIt was even difficult to get beers at the bar...we tried to have the girls order, thinking they\\'d have better luck...when that failed, the men tried...that didn\\'t work either. If we hadn\\'t REALLY wanted a cold beer after a comedy show at The Improv, we would\\'ve just left. It definitely wasn\\'t busy enough to be noticed and ignored by the bartender, so I can\\'t overlook it. Of course, the service has always been spotty at Rock Bottom, so it was hardly surprising.\\n\\nCombine the weak food and poor service with Rock Bottom being too far from home for a night out just to drink, and you get the exact formula that\\'s kept me from going there in the past...and will keep me from going often in the future.'],\n",

       "  u'Rock Bottom was our first stop on a 17 mile pub crawl.  As expected, the bar was lively, the food was good, and the service was accommodating,  The beers are better than Church Brew Works and the bar was populated.  The bartender readily offered a taste of beer and gave us a hat to wear for the rest of the crawl.  \\nI vote for Rock Bottom as the anchor store of the Water Works.'],\n",

       "  u'I haven\\'t been to Rock Bottom in years.  Maybe even decades...is that even possible?  Well, either way, it\\'s been awhile.  So with my gift certificate I took my brother out for a birthday dinner.  \\n\\nAs I get older, my tolerance for things like crowds and youngsters gets lower and lower.  As a result, I told my brother to be ready by 4pm so we could head to the Waterfront before everyone goes out for date night.  Plus the Pirates were playing at 4:05 so we could enjoy our beers and the game.\\n\\nWhen we arrived, the bar side was already pretty packed but we were still able to get a table.  Our server was very attentive, friendly and helpful.  Right off the bat we both ordered samplers so we could try all of their beers.  We loved the fact that as she approached our table with a full tray of samples our server said, \"I have to go back for the rest.\"  In all we were served 10 different beers each (in 3 oz glasses, maybe 4 - I can never tell).  I gotta say, Rock Bottom knows their beer.  I liked more than I didn\\'t, and very few were not to my liking.  So the $6.95 10 beer sampler was well worth it.  \\n\\nDuring our sampling we indulged on some Southwest Egg Rolls.  They were okay, but not quite what I expected.  The spicy ranch was top notch, though.  As we ran out of beer, we each ordered up a Kobe Burger.  They were both cooked exactly to our liking (medium).  And to top off our wonderful evening, the Pirates brought home a win!\\n\\nMy only complaint, as a beer drinker, is the cost for a growler.  The glass container itself is sold for $12.95.  That\\'s the empty price.  To me, that\\'s a little ridiculous when East End only charges $3 for the bottle and Penn Brewery $5.  Paying more for the bottle than the beer inside seems like insanity to me.  So I walked out empty handed.    But it won\\'t deter me from returning.'],\n",

It was delish! The ketchup was so good and the fries were extremely crispy. \\n\\nThe prices are a little steep for lunch but if you go on Monday, it's totally worth it.

I have had several of their beers and all of them have been forgettable. \\n\\nTheir food is pretty much like their beers, forgettable.

Docking one star due to a few unfortunate things that happened, otherwise I'd be fine giving this place a 3.\\n\\nOur waiter was very attentive and kept our water and soda cups refilled, the food was decent overall - I had a plain ol' burger and a delicious berry sangria - and the place overall had a nice vibe to it and was pretty comfortable and fun to be in...you'd think this would just be another average place not-great-but-not-bad and I'd be ready to go on to the next review right there.\\n\\nHere's where I ran into problems. I'd checked the website in advance to try and plan my meal since I do my best to pick items on menus that aren't, say, 2,000 calories in one sitting. Their website advertises that they make skinny drinks; when I asked my waiter he said it was possible but that they did not normally do this and that it's a hassle for the people at the bar, so he didn't recommend it. Then why tell us on your website that you'll do it??? \\n\\nAdditionally, while we had checked in advance when we made our reservation about bringing a birthday cake and the restaurant's ability to handle us lighting candles, apparently there was a break down in communication; we never got the candles we had asked for, and in fact the poor waiter struggled to even find a lighter before realizing there were no candles available. Obviously whatever error occurred wasn't the waiter's fault, and we definitely thanked him and tipped him well for doing the best that he could with what he had.\\n \\nOn a final note, this is also one of those places where if you ask for a medium rare burger, they will overcook it; I've started ordering medium rare on purpose specifically so that I get a medium cooked burger instead of medium well or well done.\\n\\nFinal verdict: go for the brews if you must, and the food's nice enough.

My shower was wonderful, the wait staff was great and kept everyone's glasses full.  It started pouring down rain and they let us stay a little longer so my gifts wouldn't get wet when taking them out to the car.  The only reason this place gets 4 stars is because we were not allowed to take our leftover food from the buffet home.  There was salmon, chicken, potatoes, and mac and cheese left over and they told us we couldn't box it up.  Not sure why- they can't re-serve it!

The food was standard pub fare with a twist, well-executed.  My burger was topped with onion petals and gorgonzola, and cooked to perfection.  The waitress recommended their macaroni and cheese for a side, which was definitely a good choice.

The place was pretty busy, we had to walk around the bar area for several minutes until a nice couple told us they were about to leave and we could have their bar table.  As nice as this was of them it was awkward standing over them as they finished their drinks paid their bill and left.  \\n\\nSo finally seated I look over the drinks and being the huge IPA lover that I am I went with that and it was indeed a good choice.  The hubby had the Red Ale which was also rather good.\\n\\nThe service was OK, not the best not the worst.  But moving on to more important thing, the food.  Talk about missing the mark hugely!  I ordered the mini street fish tacos.  You get four mini tacos with a marinated in lime piece of fish, and tomatillo salsa.  They were just strokes away from inedible.  I love fish tacos, I mean it is such a simple concept so why do people have such a hard time executing this dish? The shells were hard and literally split at the bottom when I picked them up.  The sour cream sprayed all over the plate only made them messy and the poor fish was just so overcooked.  If I wasn't so hungry I wouldn't have eaten them at all! Lesson learn on that.\\n\\nThe husband had the BBQ Chicken Pizza.  It had beans and corn with roasted red pepper on it along with some sour cream.  My husband is usually the type that will order these lovely specialty pizza's and ask for them to remove all the wonderful unique toppings!  For instance, he would usually just say, Chicken BBQ and cheese, nothing else!  I refused to let him do that this time, because I was really intrigued in the combination of ingredients on this pie.  And boy was I jealous when it came out.  It blew my crappy tacos out of the water!  Should have stuck with something simple.  \\n\\nFurthermore I could care less if I come back to this location.  The beers were good but hell you can get a decent IPA just about anywhere anymore.  And the underwhelming food sealed the deal.  I know this is a chain, but it still doesn't have to stink...\"],\n",

The one chain that I can't break from is rock bottom. \\n\\nTheir beer is always good- as far as their staples go, I really love their white ale. Their seasonal IPAs have been good and my favorite seasonals of all time included their chocolate raspberry stout (...yes, it tasted as good as it sounds; they had it last year around Christmas) and their smoky BBQ brown ale (tasted like summer, complemented BBQ amazingly ; they had it this past summer, I bought a growler of it lol). \\n\\nAs far as their food goes, I typically stay away from the appetizers. $10 and up is a little too pricey for me as far as appetizers go. I've had their southwestern rolls and they were good but not worth $10. \\n\\nAlmost every time I go I order the Baja chicken sandwich. It's my favorite chicken sandwich! So good. The chicken is actually grilled (which goes for all of their chicken sandwiches) and I love the charred flavor that it has. The bun is soft but sturdy and doesn't fall apart while eating the sandwich, the sauce is amazing, the onion frizzles are the best and last but not least... There's a half of a fresh avocado on this sandwich. Mhm! I love it. My boyfriend usually gets the hickory BBQ bacon chicken sandwich and loves it as well. \\n\\nAnother item I ALWAYS get... Their apple coleslaw. I've yet to find better coleslaw in a restaurant. So simple, yet oh so good. \\n\\nThey also recently changed their fries and these are much better than their old ones. \\n\\nTheir side salads are awesome as well. They are decent in size- spring mix topped with sunflower seeds, raisins, half of a hard boiled egg (which I give to the boyfriend), chopped cucumbers and tomatoes and croutons. Yum! \\n\\nI usually order the same thing every time I go. I steered off my normal path once and ordered the buffalo Mac and cheese and found it to be quite tasteless. Which turned me off to trying new items there. Plus I am just too in love with the Baja chicken sandwich and apple coleslaw to want to try anything else. \\n\\nService is always great, the bartenders are friendly... I love this place. Ask about their rock bottom rewards !\"],\n",

I then opened the menu, scanned looking for those select bar items to pair with my great beer. I saw an extensive list of items, from chicken fingers to salads. I noticed a Ball Park Pretzel, with a jalape\\xf1o cheese dip. I was blown away, the fact that I got 2 pretzels amazed me. I ordered within 25 minutes of seating. My pretzels hit the table within minutes. The smell of the warm salt and hot cheese opened my senses. But I knew we could step this shit up, I asked for mustard. And what do you know. Grey Poupon Dijon Mustard is in front of my eyes. I combined that shit and life evolved. I went to heaven, it took me 35 minutes to write this review because I took a solid bite with Grey Poupon after each sentence. Good look Rock Bottom, keep up the good work.'],\n",

We have had 1 maybe 2 not so great visits but for the most part, service is EXCELLENT and the food is consistent!  After leaving another restaurant (just trying to do something new for a celebration) because of poor service, we were greeted and seated in a few seconds!  Our server was at our table within seconds even though she had a large (10 to 12 guests) Group at the table near us. We had our drinks in minutes and were checked on twice within 5 minutes.

Our server was a spunky brunette who was very attentive and even let us sample as many beers as we liked until deciding. I ultimately decided on the Pom-berry Cosmo which was excellent. I also got the ball park pretzel which is amazing. During happy hour it's only $5 and you get two big pretzels served with this delicious cheese dip. My friends got the nachos, the quesadilla, and the artichoke cheese dip. Everything was very tasty.\"],\n",

The server was a very nice person and was very attentive.  She when over the specials and took our drink order.   Going through the menu one thing that caught my eye was the BBQ Brisket Stuffed Burger.  That just sounded so good.  Unfortunately the reality didn't match the idea of the burger.  The favor of the BBQ never came through and the smoked Gouda flavor was none existent. It was like having a standard old boring burger.  I was very disappointed.  For $14, I would have expected a lot more flavor.  I would not recommend this burger unless they do something to bunch up the flavor.\"],\n",

Whether increasing the number of diners at the last minute or providing separate checks, they are flawless. Lots of other restaurants could learn from them. Impressively, even with providing separate checks to such large groups, they chose not to add gratuity (and we obliged with good tips), l managed to deliver food to everyone at the same time, and processed payment of the checks in no time at all. Bravo to this restaurant's management and service staff, it's top notch.\\n\\nThat being said, the food and beer aint all that bad either! Fish & Chips, chicken mac'n cheese, salmon bites, guacamole and the Maker's Mark burger are all quite good, as are the beers (the K\\xf6lsch is my favorite!).\"],\n",

Sounds like a good time, but be careful or you\\'ll end up on the rock bottom.\\n\\nAfter a 30 minute wait staring at half of an empty restaurant with the usual goofy decor you would find at a Buffalo Wild Wings, we were finally seated. We could feel the tension from other diners that something wasn\\'t right. The manger was running around apologetically and the food was casually sunbathing under the heat lamps. We immediately ordered a few apps but just like GOT, and now our watch begins.\\n\\nWe waited and waited to finally receive the saddest, tiniest plates of food with bloated chain restaurant prices. The food was uninspired, tired, and ordinary. The only reason why I am giving them 2 stars is because of the extremely gracious and apologetic wait staff who took off 20% of our meal due to the terrible service. \\n\\nSo if you have decided to take a seat at Rock Bottom, take comfort in knowing that even the staff seems to know your pain.'],\n",

Our server Matt was easy to work with and informative. \\n\\nI started off with the tortilla soup. Spicy and thick it went down easy enough. However let me say that the price at $3.50 was rather steep for the serving size. Did somebody say OUCH!! Thing one and thing two each had the 'small fry steaks'  with fruit (cantaloupe, melons, and grapes) and steamed broccoli and at $6.75 each, I think I was 'buffaloed' IF  you get my drift. The steak consisted of three small thinly sliced pieces of .... Hmmm. \\n\\nThey say that kids say the darnedest things well thing one noticed that his steak was very very gristly, and thing two noticed that his was rather dry. Not the best dinner they have eaten. They say you get what you pay for OR NOT!!  \\n\\nMy meal consisted of the Chicken Bacon Mac & Cheese  and at $14.75 I had no complaints. It was filing hot and load with chicken and bacon. How can anything be wrong with that much BACON!!! \\n\\nThe final dinner consisted of chicken fried chicken and at $13.95 my mother in law was sated. Over all this meal was a wash. If anyone from Rock Bottom corporate reads this... You may seriously want to rethink you portion sizes. \\n\\nAs you know I vote with my feet and dollars, and neither will be there again ANY time soon!!\"],\n",

The menu has gone from something for everyone to a couple of overpriced entrees and a bunch of small plates that are ok but not great. The service has also suffered tremendously. We are abandoning this restaurant.\\n\\nI don't expect this Rock Bottom to be around too much longer.  In the past, on nights when the Pirates were playing out of town, the bar and the restaurant would be packed.  Last night, it was only slightly busy.  You can usually tell when an eatery is suffering by the amount of staff on a given night and the conditions of the bathroom.  The staff was overwhelmed and the bathrooms were filthy and in serious need of repairs.  Alas, I don't think that Rock Bottom will still be in business in six months.  Hopefully, if that happens, Black Rock Bar & Steak House will find its way into Pittsburgh.\"],\n",

       "  u\"I love Rock Bottom. I don't frequent the restaurant side of RB as much as I do SingSing, but the food comes from RB. I order practically the same thing every time (Bacon Mac 'n Cheese, Brewery Nachos, and a beer...usually an IPA or a Manhattan) and the last two times I was at RB, the food was disappointing: it was cold and unappetizing, my Manhattan sucked, and the service was worse. The food is always better over at SingSing for some reason...even if they do come from the same place! \\n\\nI was craving the Mac 'n Cheese, so I went down to pick some up. I had a gift card, so I figured I wasn't out any money if the food sucked. I saw that there was a new menu, so I sat down to order. I got the Street Food Quesadilla, Bacon Mac 'n Cheese, and Beer Battered Onion Rings. I also ordered a Homemade Root beer and a few samples of the house beer.\\n\\nEverything was amazing! It came out hot and tasted awesome. They have a new Head Chef and it shows. I was floored...the new Street Food options are fun and tasty. They are unique and different...not something you'd find at any restaurants in the area.\\n\\nThe Service was good. My waitress was named Liz and she certainly was on point. She even helped me find a beer after I was sorely disappointed by the IPA offering...which was weird. I always thought the House Brews were tasty and fun, no matter their style or make. I'm an IPA girl, but I would happily drink anything that came from their taps. I was disappointed in the offerings, but I ended up settling on the Pale Ale that was quite tasty.\\n\\nIn the end, if you were turned off by Rock Bottom before, I'd definitely recommend going back to check out the Street Food and new menu offerings. Service has dramatically improved, food quality has improved,  and I was thrilled.\"],\n",

The Improv is a great venue for upcoming and new comedians, I always see new, local talent opening for national comedians. In one show you will see 1-2 local comedians, and 1-2 national touring comedians. The Improv has a nice environment inside with general admission seating (first come, first serve). The EMAIL LIST is essential in order to receive free ticket packages and perks, as well as reminders of upcoming comedians!\\n\\nCons: Prices can be steep (it is expensive/difficult to be a regular). Food and Drinks are not cheap (no specials). Expect to pay $15- $40 for tickets depending on the headliner with a two item minimum. Waiting in line before the shows wouldn't be bad if you weren't forced to stand outside in any and all weather conditions. If it is raining and you'd like a good seat, you will pay the price. \\n\\nOverall: This 21+ venue is a great place to spend a night out with friends or loved ones. You may buy tickets in advance online/phone or buy your tickets at the box office at the location. I highly recommend joining the mailing list to receive free tickets!

       "  u\"The place does what it does best - Comedy.  The food, however.  Blah.\\n\\nFirst off, If you go to a show, please note there is a two item per person minimum.  This means that from their extensive menu of overpriced bar food and drinks, you are REQUIRED to choose two items each.    \\n\\nSecond, the sodas are NOT FREE REFILLS!  I learned that one the hard way.  Get water. \\n\\nThird, before tipping your server, please make sure she hasn't already taken her cut out.  Even after paying for two very bland, overpriced meals and way too many Diet Cokes, I thought that my bill was rather high.  Upon further inspection, I noticed that my server had taken an 18% gratuity.  The menu explicitly says that an automatic gratuity will be taken out for parties of six or more, but there was only two of us and we weren't even drunk.  I found this tactic awfully presumptuous and left her tip at the 18% even though I typically tip well over 20%.    \\n\\nOverall, I don't like the idea of being required to purchase food just to see a comedy show.  I can see why they do it, but if I were required to buy a crappy popcorn and overpriced pop every time I went to the movies, I would be far less inclined to go as I am not inclined to go to the Improv again.\"],\n",

       "  u'The Pittsburgh Improv is unfortunately another great idea hamstrung by the details of mediocre execution (some specific examples at the end).\\n\\nThe setup is nice, a delightful--if a bit sterile--reproduction of what you\\'d think a comedy club should like if you watch enough TV.  The interior is clean; the seats are comfortable; and it\\'s an OK atmosphere to see a show and laugh.\\n\\nIt\\'s too small, however, to attract many of the best acts, which limits its ability to ever become the central hub for Pittsburgh comedy.  Most of the big names that have recently come through Pittsburgh--Jim Gaffigan, Louis CK, Second City--all perform elsewhere (though they managed to get Bob Saget, to their credit).\\n\\nBut the biggest problem is the food and drink.  They\\'re very up front about their mandatory two item minimum, but the forced service requires that you spend extra money and get interrupted by waitstaff at least several times during the show.  The prices are well above what I\\'d consider reasonable given the quality, and I\\'d begrudgingly--or even happily--just shrug off the cost the same way I would a stadium concession stand markup...but the food is bad.  You\\'re forced to either (a) buy extremely overpriced drinks (3.50 for a soda, for example, with no refills--or ten dollars for one with refills), or (b) buy moderately overpriced food which you wouldn\\'t want in the first place.  I thought the ten dollar chicken sandwich looked reasonable, until a few bites in I decided I\\'d rather just throw away the money than keep eating it.\\n\\nStill, I think this place has a lot of potential; the core idea is very workable; and they do attract some really good comedians.  Two stars for now, with high hopes for improvements.\\n\\nA few specific drawbacks which could be VERY easily fixed:\\n1 - A lot of the drinks didn\\'t have prices on them.  I know this isn\\'t uncommon, but at a venue where every question you ask interrupts not only your own show-viewing experience as well as the experiences of your neighbors, it\\'s an incredibly poor decision here.  Make everything on the menu exceptionally clear.  It\\'s not that hard.\\n2 - Put the drink prices on the website too.  An Improv representative has personally responded to many of these Yelp reviews, and she once said \"Our menus and pricing are listed on our website, which makes for easy planning!\"  I\\'m calling shenanigans.  Not all the prices are on the website, which makes for difficult planning.\\n3 - Reminding me to tip my server during the show AND adding an automatic gratuity to the check makes me feel like you\\'re trying to trick me.  It\\'s kind of an unprofessional way to say goodbye to one\\'s customers.\\n4 - Since the $3.50 soft drinks don\\'t come with free refills, the servers shouldn\\'t ask \"would you like a refill on that?\" or anything of the sort.  They should ask \"would you like another one?\" instead.  They should also respond to requests for refills by saying \"we don\\'t offer refills, but I\\'d be happy to get you another one.\"  Just because there\\'s a 10 dollar refillable soda option on the menu doesn\\'t mean people all figure it out.  Most patrons don\\'t even bother reading the beverage section of the menu if all they want is a standard beverage offered almost everywhere (like a cola or diet cola), and the reading difficulties imposed by the darkness make them even less likely to browse the offerings.'],\n",

       "  u'My husband and I went to do something fun. The comedy was great!  The food, however, is mediocre at best. In addition, we were seated in the last row, and 10 minutes into the headliner they sat someone else at our table, so that they were in front of us. I could not see a thing. When we received our check, they had added an 18% gratuity without permission or notification.  I will not be returning anytime soon.'],\n",

       "  u'We came to the Improv for the first time on Friday night for my wife\\'s work holiday party. We arrived early for dinner and drinks from a predetermined menu. Dinner started with a salad of clearly bagged, almost brown iceberg lettuce, with some croutons and frozen-then-thawed looking tomatoes that were pinkish at best. I took a few bites of this unappetizing poor excuse for a salad, and I can tell you it was downright tragic. Dinner arrived and since there wasn\\'t any vegetarian options on this predetermined menu, we received a dish that was supposed to contain meat with the meat omitted. It was a huge pile of spaghetti in a bowl. It looked sloppy and tasted worse than it looked. The pasta was overcooked, and the tomato sauce was just watered down pur\\xe9ed canned tomatoes. I saw traces of onion in my dish but didn\\'t taste them at all. I was so hungry that I salted the heck out of this abomination and took a few bites. Yuck. I didn\\'t make a dent in this crapfest. For dessert we were given a choice of chocolate cake, which my wife ordered, and cheesecake, which I ordered. The chocolate cake had freezer burn. Inexcusable! It wasn\\'t edible. The cheesecake was only a hair better, but it had obviously come out of the freezer as well. I know people aren\\'t coming here for the food, but if you are FORCING them to order things off of your menu to fulfill some outdated requirements (two drink/two menu item minimum) then at least make some halfway decent food. It doesn\\'t even have to be memorable...just not OFFENSIVE. Which it was!! Had I paid for any of this I would have made a huge stink, but I tried to be polite and push my food around and make small talk. \\n\\nThe comedians were good. The venue was nice-ish and we got to sit in the front because we arrived early for our \"event\". Not always the best thing in a comedy club (we only got picked on a little bit). But damn, I was hungry! I found myself fantasizing about all of the crappy Waterfront restaurants and how I\\'d rather be there...how I\\'d rather be heating up a discount microwave dinner...how I\\'d rather have a giant bowl of Captain Crunch...how I\\'d rather go back in time and eat spaghetti from my high school cafeteria...what a dreadful dining experience.\\n\\nMy car was also violated in the parking lot. I had an adorable German license plate on the front of my adorable German car which was stolen while I was eating hideous food, which was just the slap in the face I wanted when finally retreating to my car. I feel sick in so many different ways about this experience as a whole.\\n\\nThe Improv should consider outsourcing the food prep to a catering company. I truly believe that\\'s the only thing that can save this place. Do yourself a favor and eat beforehand, and just order a beer. Well, two I guess. Other diners at our table complained about the quality of the cocktails so I\\'d steer clear of those. Unless there is a can\\'t miss type of comedian here, I can\\'t ever picture going back to the Improv. I\\'d give the comedians 4 stars, and the food ZERO stars.'],\n",

We were all looking forward to it and it was hilarious! He was wonderful. \\n\\nThe servers were fantastic. They always came back to check in on us and make sure we had plenty to eat and drink. I suggest the Pink Cadillac for a drink as well as the cheese cake and chocolate cake for dessert. \\n\\nThe only reason it isn't 5 stars is because they had us wait an hour past the time we were to enter the building. We were to see the 9pm showing so the doors were to open at 8:45pm. They came out and explained that the show had run over and we wouldn't be able to even enter the building until 9:20pm. It was 28 degrees outside. We finally were able to enter the building, order drinks then the show finally started at 9:45pm.  The host did offer a blanket apology which was nice but hardly made up for the fact the show started almost an hour late.\"],\n",

We had to sit all the way in the back and the comedian was not that good (although that is no fault of the club). But when I went to the second show, the service was much improved. The burger I ordered was fantastic and warm. Our waitress kept the drinks coming without interrupting us while the comedian was on stage. We were also able to sit in the front this time and it was a great experience. I'll be going back soon!\"],\n",

       "  u\"I was so excited when my husband gave me tickets to go here to see funny man Bill Crawford, part of the DVE morning show for those of you who never heard of him.  That is funny because as I was telling people about going it became clear there are A LOT of people that haven't... Oh Well... Let me mention this was my first time there.\\n\\nSo I was warned in advance of the possible long waits outside and the two item minimum.  Well to my pleasant surprise there was no wait, walked right in, greeted, an usher showed us to our seats and we waited less than 5 minutes to be asked for our order.  This was nice.  I will say that the show started at 8pm, and we were there by 7:20 or so.  There were already people seated so we were by no means very early, and heck there were people with full course meals and tables of 10.  The price of the mixed drinks were not disclosed on the menu, leading me to believe that it may leave me short for the mortgage next month, but they did have a 60 minute dogfish head IPA for $6.00.  Now that may seem rather expensive and it is, but doable so I indeed did it... My husband got a domestic and it was between 4-5 bucks.  We opted not to eat there, as we were going to Rock Bottom after wards and I will get to that review later...\\n\\nSo the show was good.  There were moments that I think the comedians may have went off track and were just bantering, but luckily enough they rebound and got back to making everyone laugh instead of being uncomfortable.  There were a total of 4 comedians, the MC, and two opening acts for Crawford.  I actually really enjoyed them.  \\n\\nThe one or two things I didn't like about the place.  The bathrooms are in the lobby.  As this seems normal there is no separate area to enter back into the room without having to make your way through people who are waiting to be seated... This was/is stupid.  I was actually nervous that they were going to stop me and ask for my ticket which they safely secured at my first entrance.  The same also goes for smoking.  Since we were so early I took a break and it was again awkward reentering.  Maybe they need to have some type of system to get around this.  A stamped hand?  A ticket stub?  Not sure but I know I would have felt better unlike feeling like I was sneaking into the place.  \\n\\nI would definitely return to the Improv.  I just hope I always have a rather positive experience!\"],\n",

My only complaint was that it was a little pricey for the overall experience because not only do you need to buy a ticket, but every person needs to buy 2 items of food/drink and the drinks aren't cheap (around $10-12).  However, I would definitely go back sometime!\"],\n",

       "  u\"Absolutely loved it at the Improv! I saw Sheryl Underwood and she was fantastic. It was my first time being at the Improv. After years of saying that I wanted to go, it really did meet my expectations! The ambiance is inviting, with warm lighting and a good amount of seating for a smaller place. We were 8th in line so we had good choice of seating, though we were encouraged to fill the seats in the front by the stage first. The seating is layered in tiers. Each tier has a long booth with tables and chairs for seating. It was very comfortable, roomy and an interactive set up. The stage is close to the seating (some tables are right at the stage) with little space between you and the comedian, which made it very interactive and fun. We arrived at the Improv around 9:45 pm for a show that started at 10:30 pm, with doors opening at 10:00 pm. We waited in line until the doors opened at about 10:15-10:20 pm, so they were really behind schedule. The show started around 10:45 pm with two opening comedians before the main act. The show was over around 1:00 am. The only negatives were that the staff was not very friendly and immediately told me that I have to buy a minimum of two items off of the menu. ($30/ticket isn't enough?) I was not hungry and did not want to drink, so this was a bit frustrating, especially because it wasn't disclosed on the ticket or anywhere else. The server did not hold us to the 2 minimum purchase requirement and my friend and I got away getting 3 drinks for the night. The food menu looked great and the prices seemed reasonable, though if you want water you are looking at $5 for Fiji or sparkling. It was $8 for a glass of wine. $11 for bottomless soda, complete with a take home Improv glass. The other thing that I didn't like was that an employee takes your tickets while you're waiting in line and marks your hands with a dry erase marker. After one bathroom trip, the mark was gone, so I think they need a more effective way to mark you as an already paid customer since the employee takes your proof of purchase. These negatives did not affect my overall experience negatively and I would most certainly go back! It is a fun place where you are guaranteed to have a good time with a lot of laughter!\"],\n",

The space itself is fine...only a few blind spots, nice intimate venue. They bring decent acts in, although they have a lot of repeats and need to bring in more new acts. But the two item minimum just infuriates me. Overpriced, shitty food and drinks. We went to see Lachlan Patterson last night (hilarious show, very nice guy, signed our CD and posed for photos with people). We dropped $40 on a chicken quesadilla, 6 hot wings, and 2 Yuengling drafts. The whole time I just sit there thinking about all the amazing places I COULD have eaten for $40. Burgatory is right down the street. Hell, TGI Friday's would have been better. I've been to other comedy places in other cities and they often have minimums but everything is either a lot cheaper or a lot better quality.  The Improv's saving grace is that they often have free or very cheap tickets.\"],\n",

That is all well and good if it is summertime but it was 4 degrees.  People stood out there upwards of 20 minutes, freezing.  They didn't let people in because they claimed the room was not ready.  Seating is first come, first served.  Whoever designed this place should be shot.  There is no lobby to hold people before a show.  The Improv in Cleveland is superb.  That location has a huge lobby and bar where you can mingle before the show and they have ushers seat you.  The Pittsburgh Improv is a disaster layout-wise.  Beverage service was fine.  It got really, really warm in the room and even the comedian was sweating like a freak show.

       "  u\"Let me preface this by saying, I generally compare all grocery stores to Publix, maybe even Kroger. That being said, the one thing Giant Eagle (GE) has going for it is the quality and selection of items. There is no question that it has everything you could want. That's where the praise ends. Let's just do this numerically...\\n\\n1. Prices are outrageous. If you walk 100 yards over to the Target next to it, you'll find some of the same items for 30-40% cheaper. A bag of Gevalia coffee is $7.99 at GE, the same coffee at Target is $4.99. And it's not just coffee, and not just Target. Giant Eagle has little other grocer competition in Pittsburgh. This being the case, if you're not near an Aldi's, Target or Walmart, you have to go to GE for stuff. They're banking on this lack of competition. \\n\\n2. Parking lots are thrashed every day, all the time. Now, maybe you don't care. But when I go in the morning, they've been open maybe 30 minutes and there are shopping carts littering the parking lot and the sidewalk in front of the building. They clearly don't bring them in at the end of the night. They also rarely have any small baskets near the door, you'll need to hunt for one. It's just laziness and a lack of care, on both accounts. They don't care about the appearance of the outside, nor the convenience for the customers. \\n\\n3. I don't normally mind the self-checkout, but only if I have a limited number of items. If I need a full grocery order, I'm going to have to wait in line for one of the two cashiers working the registers, on a Saturday. The lack of customer service in this regard is atrocious. I'm already paying exorbitant prices, but I also have to ring up and bag my cart full of groceries too? Walmart doesn't even make you do that!\\n\\nSo that's about it. If you don't mind paying much higher than average grocery prices, ringing and bagging your cart full of groceries and generally being an afterthought as a customer, than Giant Eagle in Waterfront is awesome!\"],\n",

The weight of the skirt caused even larger holes than what were placed there by the pins.  Being that it's a pencil skirt designed to have a blouse tucked in, there's no way that I can wear it again.  This was an expensive skirt, completely ruined.  Very disappointed.

The first time they misread a prescription and gave me the wrong dose of Synthroid, about 1/10th of what I needed. I ended up so sick after 2 weeks of taking too little that I was half dead before the problem was caught. Their response when I told them was to say \"oops\" and \"it won\\'t happen again\". Not even a sorry, and it never did happen again b/c I went to Costco after that. This latest time was classic. I came with a simple scrip. Costco was closed so I went to Giant Eagle. After 45 minutes the finally inform me that they can\\'t fill it b/c the scrip isn\\'t specific enough (it was for a common antibiotic, nothing complicated). They didn\\'t bother to call me earlier or tell me sooner, just made me wait and wait and wait until I pitched a fit to tell me that they couldn\\'t fill it. It was late and I went to Rite Aid in Sq. Hill with the same exact scrip and they had ZERO issues filling it quickly. WTF? How can it be easy peasy at Rite Aid but Giant Eagle can\\'t even muster the effort to tell me that they are too incompetent to fill it out? I wonder if there is even a legit pharmacist working there at all.

Beating down the competition of other now defunct national competitors and mom and pop type stores alike.  \\n\\nI'm not quite sure whether I'm in a cafe, at a newspaper stand, a book store, a CD shop, a movie house or a flea market sometimes.  With all the tables and shelves that  you have to dodge it's a bit hard to figure it out.  Feels like the place should implode on itself and then reform into an audio book about coffee.\\n\\nI don't know about y'all, but I'd rather buy my books from a place that has more knowledge about the merchandise they are selling than a national chain like this.\"],\n",

       "  u'I stopped here yesterday with Rob and Matt after golf to have a few drinks prior to seeing \"The Hangover\" at Loews across the street.  Incidentally, \"The Hangover\" is one of the funniest movies I\\'ve seen in years and worth the $10 to see it in the theater.  Okay, back to the restaurant the space itself is very nice.  There are plenty of hightops, plasmas and a few booths.  It\\'s spacious and they have outdoor seating and open windows.  We sat at the bar and were greeted relatively quickly by the bartender who was tending a pretty much empty bar.  I ordered a guinness as usual, Rob ordered a long island iced tea and Matt had a miller light.  Make sure and tell them if you want a top shelf tea else you\\'ll be getting the stuff in the plastic bottles.  I sampled Rob\\'s long island tea and it was not that good way too much sours.  The next one he ordered was much better after a little guidance to the bartender.  The bartender herself was okay, not too friendly but quick enough with the pours.  I don\\'t remember her name which is usually not a good sign.  We ordered a few things from the appetizer menu.  We started with the chips and salsa.  The chips were crisp enough, but not served warm and the salsa had some spice but the colors were a little off kind of looked like the color of pea soup.  Rob then ordered the philly cheese steak sliders.  I tried one it was okay I guess  the bun was warm and it was pretty loaded with cheese and onions.  He asked for a side of mayo and they said they were out, which is bizarre because there is a giant eagle a couple blocks away.  This pretty much sums up my experiences at the Bar Louie\\'s I\\'ve been too.  They kind of do just enough for me to come back but rarely make any real effort with service.  Maybe I\\'m being too critical... I tried to order the baked goat cheese, but they were out... So, I settled on the hummus appetizer.  This was surprisingly pretty good.  The pita was warm and toasted the hummus had lots of flavor and the tabouleh was edible.  It\\'s probably best to stick to simple stuff when dining here.  Matt had the hot wings which I tried one and it was okay, your pretty standard mass produced chicken wing.  All in all this place isn\\'t that bad.  If you want to grab a drink before or after the movie and you\\'re more concerned with convenience than necessarily friendly service and really good food than you could do worse.'],\n",

Got seated and waited on immediately. Ordered drinks, and it took them 15 minutes to come...no, not alcoholic drinks, two waters and an iced tea. This should have been a bad sign, but at this point we ordered food.\\n\\n20 minutes go by...we flag down our waitress, to let her know that we need to get to a movie in 45 minutes. She said our food would be out in a few minutes. Another 20 minutes, still no food, and our waitress is nowhere to be seen. We flag down another waitress, she says she will find our waitress, who we then notice is chatting with one of the other waitresses. She finishes her conversation and finally makes her way over to our table about five minutes later. She says she didn\\'t even realize our food hadn\\'t arrived (well, you never even checked on us, so of course you didn\\'t). After speaking with the kitchen staff, she informs us that she \"definitely\" put our order in so it \"must have been given to someone else by mistake.\" Because they wouldn\\'t have noticed that that WASN\\'T what they ordered? Seriously?\\n\\nThe waitress told us she could give us our food for take out and, since we were starving, we reluctantly agreed. 10 minutes later, our food and the bill arrived. All that was comped was the iced tea, and we got some free utensils and wetnaps. How generous! We shovelled what we could into our mouths, did NOT leave a tip (thankfully, we didn\\'t have the added gratuity that John had), and sprinted to our movie where we covertly finished our smuggled food. Worst part? I opened the wetnap, and it was totally dry. Of course.\\n\\nHowever, I gave this place two stars instead of one. That\\'s because my food, when I finally got it, was perfect. I had the Greek burger and it was huge, cooked exactly how I like it, with delicious toppings. I really wish I could come back here for the food but...hell no.'],\n",

Well one day you decide to go back and you realized everything has changed in a way that you can't describe and the place is no longer familiar. To me, that is Bar Louie\\n\\nI can't say the food is bad. I had an order of the pretzel sticks for an appetizer and the cinnamon sauce tasted like water and the pretzels were stale. I will say I still ate them so shame on me. My  sandwich (the Mario) as always was very good.\\n\\nNow here comes the bad:\\n\\n1. There were fruit flies EVERYWHERE. I felt like we were eating on top of a garbage dump. At one point I had to get a new drink because one flew in my beer. I understand that the establishment is an indoor/outdoor place but there is no reason for 15 fruit flies to hover over my table.\\n\\n2. The place is enormous and they had one, very nice, but over worked server. The girl looked like she was about to have a heart attack because she never stopped moving.\\n\\n3. Because of number two our service in general was not good. I can't totally blame the girl she did the best we could. I mean. I've played Diner Dash on my iPad, I know what happens when a place fills up too quickly when you are the only one working.\\n\\nIt's sad when a place you love turns into a place you never want to go again. I think I'm being very generous by giving it two stars but because I used to love it so much I can't rate it that low.

Outside of that Bar Louie leaves a lot to be desired.\\n\\nThis is probably the first place I've been to where they charge $10 and up for all mixed drinks. To me, that is beyond ridiculous. Bar Louie is not an upscale restaurant, as much as they wish they were, and paying almost $60 for three drinks and two appetizers is insanity defined. \\n\\nAs I mentioned the waitress was friendly, but she definitely did not come back and check on us enough.

After sitting there for 5 minutes and not being acknowledged, we thought that they might not be able to see us, and so we moved to a different pair of seats in the middle of the bar, grabbing a few menus on the way so we would be ready to order. It was fairly busy, but it is not like there were people standing at the bar trying to get drinks - everyone was seated and I'm sure they face much busier times. We sat in our new seats for almost 15 minutes (I timed it - I am not exaggerating), and were not even acknowledged. You would at least think the bartender would acknowledge us and tell us he would be with us when he could, but despite staring him down almost the whole time, we could not even make eye contact.

We were looking to meet up with friends and have drinks and a quick bite to eat.  We never got to the food part because of the level of service that we received.  We got there at about 6:40/6:45 so Happy Hour was wrapping up, but I would say that the bar was not even 3/4 full.  There were also plenty of empty tables.  This should have been our sign to run in the opposite direction.  But we grabbed a table.  I am not a clock watcher, so I am not sure how long it took us to get a server but it was at least 5-7 minutes.  Then we got our drinks at 7:04.  The only reason that I know is because I was looking at my phone because my husband and I wanted to get some apps ordered before the end of Happy Hour.  That went out the window.  When our friends for there; they ordered drinks.  We finished them and left.  The server was nice, that is not the issue.  The issue was how GROSSLY UNDERSTAFFED they were.  They had two bartenders on (I think) and not nearly enough cocktail servers.  The server apologized for the wait on the drinks, but explained it away with \"this happens at the end of happy hour because the bar get swamped\".  That is a sign that you need more staff.  I have never had this happen at any other bar before.  Get more staff.  We ended up passing up on food because we were worried about time, not the fact that we did not get HH pricing.  Even though, in my opinion, they should have honored HH pricing since we were ready to order food at 7:50/7:55.  We ended up going to the Improv and got food there.  Bar Louie lost a great deal of my money because their lack of staffing and they will never get our Pittsburgh business again or our friends who live there.'],\n",

Even during the happy hour drinks are pretty costly, not to mention that I think most of the drinks I personally like don\\'t qualify for the happy hour discount, which is disappointing.

They have a decent beer selection but when I asked what their seasonal Great Lakes on tap was they said the Christmas ale (it's the last week in April now).

But my Chicago friend Catherine came in to visit for the weekend and after a day at the zoo, we donned our swimsuits and came here.  The main part of the park is closed in the evenings, but the Sandbar and the Sandbar Pool and the Hot Tub remain open for the 21 and over set.  The Sandbar has a great menu of food and drinks and has a $6.00 cover charge to get in.  Occasionally there's live entertainment.\\n\\nIt's hard to believe that before they built this place, it was the site of an abandoned steel mill.  Actually, it was the railroad yard for the nearby Homestead Works.  But after site-clearing and clean-up, they turned it into a beautiful place to spend a warm day or nice evening.  The view across the Mon is quite beautiful with a wooded hillside on the other side.  There's even a boat dock, so you can arrive by river if you desire.\\n\\nI'm glad I renewed my acquaintance with this place and hopefully, I'll get another chance to come back.\"],\n",

There are just too many misses in my book though.\\n\\n1st off all Traffic is a biatch! Be ready to sit on browns hill rd for a very long time unless you leave before 9am and wait for the park to open at 10am. \\n\\nNext remember it is a family park so there will be lots of rude and bratty kids all over the place. (I\\'m not a mean kid hater) my experiences have been bad at the Sandbar pool. \\n\\nIf you do arrive early enough you will be standing in the hot sun with a gang of kids that WILL push you out of the way and run to claim 10 chairs with towels even though they won\\'t use them because they run around the park all day. I actually got into an argument last summer with one said kid. I was like \"I\\'m an adult and you need to have some respect.\" He pushed me and took all the chairs. I only needed one and his mother did not correct him. I was on fire and moved a chair over from the back and he still was giving me crap because I moved the chairs over...THAT NO ONE was even there to sit in at the time. Damn! FOR REAL!\\n\\nSandbar drinks are expensive and incredibly weak. Plus they are so sugary. If you do get a frozen drink and sit by the pool be prepared for it to be half pool water in a few minutes.

       "  u\"So the last time I went to a water park was probably when I was in elementary school and didn't really know how to swim (... I still kinda don't. lol). Anyway, it was in California at Raging Rivers and it was a traumatizing experience. Screaming & being tossed around in the pool that pushes periodic waves at the sound of a loud horn and ending up with scraped knees and feet. Not fun.\\n\\nSo to say the least, I was a bit nervous coming to this water park afraid to have another episode of feeling I was being drowned. Luckily that did not happen.\\n\\nI seriously had SO MUCH fun here! I honestly was only expecting to go on the Lazy River pool all day but with my bf, we hit up so many rides... tandem AND single rides! I feel like such a big girl now! Definitely lean back while you're on those single donuts on the water rides, or else you feel like you're going to flip over while swishing down the tubes. The new dragon ride they just opened up was okay. I was expecting it to be so much more fun, but literally you just slide down a dark tube into a circular room where you just slowly swirl your way down the middle hole and that was it. \\n\\nThere was this one ride where you slide down the tubes for a few seconds, then you land into a pool where a worker pushes you into another tube and this continues about 3 times. It was weird. Kinda awkward with the worker having to grab you and push you through. Although it was still fun. The last dude threw me in backwards! Scared the crap out of me but it was fun :)\\n\\nThe food here is surprisingly pretty affordable. Plus, who wants to eat a huge meal while in your swim suit. Me don't want no pot belly. \\n\\nOverall I had such a fun time here. It definitely made me rethink my fear of water parks. By the way, we went on a Saturday in early June and it wasn't as packed as I thought it would be! So the lines weren't long at all. Also, go to Giant Eagle to purchase your discounted tickets. You save a few bucks versus buying them at the water park. Oh and don't forget to bring sandals while walking around. Your feet will literally feel like they're burning from the ground.

I've attempted to visit on nice weekends before when the park has actually been at capacity and they are no longer allowing people in. It gets CROWDED on the weekends, especially if the weather is nice. There aren't a ton of nice days in the summer in Pittsburgh, so when there are nice days, people come out in droves! \\n\\nThe slides are a blast, the lines are sometimes very long, but worth it. The lazy river is great when it's not wall to wall people. I really enjoy the new Dragon's Den but the line is CRAZY long for it! They also have a fantastic bar area, we have gone a few times and enjoyed a festive beverage while we enjoy the sun!\\n\\nThey have several areas for smaller children, which are all fantastic. \\n\\nIf you are visiting, trying to take advantage of the giant eagle discount tickets, because these can get really pricey.

I went in to only buy our daughter a new mattress but I bought us a new one as well. No one can beat their prices! I compared the price of our new mattress to Levin, Macy's and Mattress Discounters. No one came close to the price we got at American Buyers. Everywhere else was double the price for just our mattress not including our daughters so it was like getting hers for free.\\n \\nTake it from me, when it comes to your sleep, DO NOT BUY A CHEAP MATTRESS!!! We bought a cheap, supposed Serta mattress in 2008 from Mattress Discounters. The boxed spring had to be replaced about 2 years after owning the bed. I don't think I will have that problem again as our new Serta has a full 25 year warranty. \\n\\nA couple days later our daughters mattress was delivered first and about a week later our new mattress was delivered. The delivery guys had our old mattress and box spring out and our new frame, box spring and mattress set up in less than 10 minutes.\\n\\nI highly recommend American Buyers Discount Mattress for all of your bedding needs.\"],\n",

I must say that I was very impressed with how extensive the menu was and all of the delicious options. I had the two for $10 lunch special with French onion soup and terriakyi glazed chicken strips. I was told that the broccoli soup is very thick so I opted for the French onion. It was okay but I think that I would get a salad instead of the soup next time. The chicken strips were wonderful and I am still craving them. The portion was huge and there were leftovers. My co-workers ordered the Jack Daniels Sampler and burgers and were jealous at the portion and choices from the pick two. The service was good and we had no issues. I will definitely be back.\"],\n",

Second, the service, the host was a typical younger girl, efficient without too much professionalism, not a big deal. The waitress, a \"professional\" , but unfortunately not in the way of experienced great service, but moreso as experienced in efficiently moving things along.  Our food took a long time, and she \\'saved\\' herself by telling us that she didn\\'t know why our food wasn\\'t ready yet, but would check again, and of course, hot plates with luke-warm food came out soon after.

       "  u'I really don\\'t know why I bother with chain restaurants anymore.  Now that my palate has matured and I no longer think chicken fingers and french fries are gourmet cuisine, I really can\\'t find anything to eat in a place like this.  \\n\\nMy husband and I were running errands at the Waterfront, and we needed to find a place for lunch.  We decided on Uno because pizza sounded good to us.  My husband is a meat lover, so I agreed to let him order us a meat-covered pizza.  To counteract this a little, I ordered a tomato mozzarella salad, so we\\'d at least have some vegetables in the mix.  \\n\\nWhen the salad arrived, it did NOT look like the picture.  The menu description is thus: \"chopped lettuce, roma tomatoes with basil and garlic, buffalo mozzarella, drizzled with balsamic syrup.\"  This description is accompanied by a bright, colorful picture of a salad with bright green lettuce, bright red tomatoes, and a delicate \"drizzling\" of balsamic syrup.  It looks light and yummy.\\n\\nWhat we got, however, was soggy yellow and white iceberg lettuce, COMPLETELY DRENCHED in dressing, a total of four tiny pieces of tomato, and some cheese.  It was DISGUSTING.  There was so much dressing dripping off of this dish, it was more like a soup than a salad.  I suspect that the lettuce was so wilted and brown, they figured they could disguise it by completely soaking it in dressing.  Not only was it disgusting, but it cost us about $10.  $10 for complete inedible slop.  \\n\\nThe \"numero uno\" pizza we got was nothing to write home about either.  It was ok... very mediocre.  The crust tasted like it was undercooked, and the sauce tasted like plain tomato sauce with no seasoning whatsoever.  I have been to Chicago many times, had real Chicago deep dish many times, and this just doesn\\'t even come close to the real thing.  \\n\\nThe ONLY positive I give this restaurant is they have the kiosk in the front where you can look up the calorie count of the food right there.  It would be better if they\\'d actually print it on the menu, but they are still doing better than most restaurants in this effort.  They are making strides, too, with their whole grain crust options.  I\\'m sure there\\'s still a lot of room for improvement, however.  If you\\'re listening, Uno, please work on providing your customers with healthier food - not just healthy options like salads, but work on making the main dishes you serve better for your customers (low-fat cheese, low-sugar sauce, less sodium, etc.).   Their hearts will applaud you.  \\n\\nAnd lastly, why does every chain restaurant have to decorate with old signs?  Is there some sort of chain restaurant decorating requirement I don\\'t know about?  It\\'s baffling.'],\n",

The mixture of ingredients just sliding down your chin as it bubbles out of your mouth. That being said, I really don't understand why people go to Pizzeria Uno. This chain has done to the deep dish pizza what McDonald's has done to hamburgers, Pizza Hut has done to pan pizza, Dominoes has done to hand tossed pizza, and Taco Bell has done to Tex-Mex; it has made it almost unpalatable. On our menu:\\n\\nFrench onion\\nChicken bites\\nPizza with pepperoni, hamburger, and romano\\n\\nLooking past the fact that the service was not the best or the fact that the food came out undercooked and tepid in temperature, the food just was not good.

We both are going gluten free which is tough but UNO's gave us a nice selection of dishes to choose from. Plus! They make a thin crust gluten free pizza which taste great. My hubby ordered the mediterrean thin crust because he loves kalamata olives and I ordered the Guac-alicious burger with a Caesar side salad. My salad came out pretty quick which was nice but it had a little too much dressing on it. I didn't complain, it still tasted great.\\n\\nI'm not into red meat so I tried to order a black bean burger or get chicken instead of beef, but the ran out of black bean and they couldn't get the chicken so i just ordered it anyway. The burger was piled really high with all the toppings including guacamole and it was very creamy but i couldn't get over the taste of the burger because it just didn't have any flavor. Very saddening. I ended up just eating the veggies and discarding the meat. I snacked on some of my hubbies pizza even though it was only a small amount. \\n\\nWe came here twice in one week. The second time we ordered the 9-grain deep dish with mushrooms, parmesan and a garlic white sauce. Was this pizza amazing or what??

Hardly any people in there. Weird for the Semi-Annual Sale time of year. Usually it doesn\\'t matter what time you\\'re there during the sale, it\\'s always busy. \\n\\nI went through my usual bins and picked up a mess of undies and bras. Since no one was at the check out counter and I needed a spot to go through things, I set them down and started to try and chat with the sales chick. I actually always like to do this, just to shoot the breeze, but also to get their opinions on items I\\'m buying. \\n\\nThe girl behind the counter was having non of this though.I asked her about a bra and she said she didn\\'t know about that one, but said it should work. I understand, you can\\'t try them all. But the thing that really irked me was that she was definitely not hiding her annoyance at me setting down my things on the counter. I even looked back to make sure there were no people checking out behind me. Ghost town. Tumbleweed rolled by. No one.\\n\\nSo I\\'m going through my stuff and separating what I want and don\\'t want and she\\'s sighing and grabbing things saying \"Soooo, you DON\\'T want these???\" Um, I\\'m not asking you to help me sort things.

I don\\'t expect you to sit there and be sugary sweet either. Just do what you were hired to do. Be nice and sell some bras.

I recently had a very attentive sales associate who opened a fitting room for me when my arms were becoming full, but I thought that I noticed someone with a District Manager vibe lurking around, which probably encouraged the associate's motivation. \\n\\nI actually had a very negative experience at this store during a recent sales event. The event ended at 7pm on a weekday, and I rushed to the store after getting off work. I hurried around the store and jumped into line at 7:02pm. All associates abandoned the registers at 7pm, totally ignoring me and the other two girls waiting in line. When I was finally helped several minutes later, the snippy associate told me that the discount may or may not go through... that corporate determined when the discount was turned off. OK, that's great, but then why did you totally ignore me and your other customers for several minutes? Did you want us to not get the discount? I was appalled by the rudeness of both the associate and a manager I spoke with earlier in the evening, who was equally rude about the sharp end time of the discount. What made the situation much worse is that a good friend of mine was a manager at Loft a couple years ago and told me that ringing up after 7pm would not be a problem. Hah, well it was a problem at the Waterfront location!\\n\\nThe only reason that I gave Loft 4 stars is because I love the brand, discounts, and quality of product as a whole. The staff at this location is sub-par and do not reflect the brand well. I hope that Loft does not lose customers based on negative customer service experiences.... They're lucky that I like the product enough to ignore some occasional rudeness.\"],\n",

They usually have more chic and classic clothes which I love. The staff is exceptional here. I love that they are really trying to help finding the right clothes for you instead of telling you \"how beautiful everything looks on you\". I always feel welcomed and I really do appreciate the fact that I am not being approached by a staff member every two minutes (this unfortunately happens in a lot of other stores in this area).

       "  u\"When I lived in Los Angeles a year and a half ago, P F Chang's was no great shakes, one of millions of places with good but not outstanding stuff on the menu.\\n\\nHere in Pittsburgh, it's the only Chinese place I've found that combines genuinely good service with quality food.  Not, perhaps, as good as what you can get in LA's top places, but fantastic compared to its competition here.\\n\\nThe Kung Pao chicken is particularly good, with delicious fried chicken cubes and the usual hot sauce and chiles.  Chicken with lettuce wraps is good too.\\n\\nTheir fried noodle dish with chicken, whose name I have forgotten, is addictive but has an odd sauce I don't quite like.  Still, they get the friedness of the noodles right, and there are precious few ... ahem ... no other restaurants around here that do.\\n\\nPortions are small, so either plan to get an appetizer and an entree or expect to leave almost as hungry as you came.  The minced chicken in lettuce wraps appetizer is outstanding and you get about the same amount of food as in one of their entrees.\\n\\nIf you live in LA, forget P F Chang's.

They also make sure to clean down the area they prepare the specialty dinner so as to avoid cross-contamination.  I don\\'t know many other restaurants that go this far.\\n\\nAside from the menu preference, I enjoy my overall experience every time.  Their menu is a bit different than that of what most people will be used to if you regularly eat a Chinese Take-Out or Buffet joints.  Don\\'t expect this to be at all like that.  It\\'s not a Buffet.  They don\\'t sell \"General Tso\\'s\" (though Chang\\'s Spicy Chicken is recommended for those looking for something similar, it\\'s my personal favorite) or other signature foods that you may expect.  They do sell very similar items with different names and a few of their own adjustments, just make sure to read the menu description and ask questions if you are not sure.  They also sell Sake, I believe they have a few different types.  \\n\\nThe prices can get a bit more expensive than your average Chinese Restaurant depending on what you get but it\\'s well worth it.  Portions are excellent and the taste is great.  I\\'ve yet to have one complaint and I have frequented this establishment several times over the span of a few years.\\n\\nThe only downside, it can be a little crowded and a bit loud.

       "  u\"REDO!\\n\\nI went to PF Chang's several years ago and was NOT pleased with the food that was presented to me.  \\n\\nMy issue: I thought I was getting Chinese food.  \\n\\nMy resolution: Try this restaurant again knowing that it is just reinvented American food with names of those Chinese dishes I actually like to eat.\\n\\nSo we returned to PF Chang's for lunch to try this American food in this caricature of a Chinese restaurant.  There were very few people in the restaurant.  The two of us were seated in the largest corner booth and left to review our menus.  When our waitress finally arrived we ordered the following items:\\n\\nCoca Cola\\nIced Tea\\nPan fried pork dumplings\\nSesame chicken lunch with white rice and egg drop soup\\nChangs chicken with white rice\\n\\nOur drinks and my soup came out immediately.  Unfortunately I was brought the wrong soup and the server had disappeared before I had a chance to say anything.  I could see her across the barren wasteland that was the dining room and we even made eye contact several times, but at no point could I get her to come back to my table.  I tried the soup and was disgusted with it and placed it at the end of the table.  I didn't know what it was and didn't want to know.  Almost ten minutes later she arrived quite happy with the job she was doing and asked how the food was.  I asked if she could bring out some egg drop soup. I didn't expect to get the stink-eye.\\n\\nMy egg drop soup was brought out with the dumplings as well as the caddy of different sauces and oils.  The server really wasn't that into the experience, but again gave me the stink-eye when I told her that mixing the sauces was unnecessary since I knew what each of them was and would be able to mix them myself.  I mixed the rice vinegar, chili oil, chili paste, and soy sauce (my guess is that it was supposed to be tamari) to create a dipping sauce for our dumplings. I took a bite of the soup and it was somewhat better than the other soup, but it was still brown.  I ate half the bowl and left the rest for the server.  It was thick and gooey and the flavor didn't wow.  I saw no reason to continue.  I moved on to the dumplings, which had an okay flavor to them.  The skins were a bit thick and doughy.  The meat on the inside did not balance this attribute at all.  The sauce tasted a little odd so I tried to remix and it was still off.  I tried the components individually and found that some of them were either old, stale, or rancid.  We finished our dumplings.\\n\\nOur lunch entrees arrived.  I had ordered mine extra-spicy, but I guess it came Pittsburgh Hot (super mild) and had a lackluster flavor at best.  The meat was tough and the sauce tasted of soy sauce more than anything else.  I tried some of Chang's chicken and was equally mollified.  This was supposed to be their version of General Tso's Chicken.  Now I have never had a General's chicken that was the same at any place.  It is always different.  Many of them are good in different ways.  This food, though, it wasn't good.  Chang's chicken fell into the same category as the Sesame Chicken -- since it tasted mainly of soy sauce -- with the addition sugar.  \\n\\nI just don't understand how anyone can like this place.  Even the Yoshida Sauce you get at Sam's/Costco tastes better.\"],\n",

       "  u\"Honestly, I'm furious. I enjoyed PF Chang's restaurants in the Chicago area, and my wife and I have eaten a few times at this Pittsburgh-area location. Over the last year, we have tried repeatedly, but the 90-120 minute wait for dinner is unacceptable. We tried going early, late -- it never made any difference. The front staff was rude, and the wait was too long.\\n\\nTonight, we had a special date planned, and made reservations a week in advance. We came in the door exactly on time, waited in the line to see the front staff, and we were promptly handed a pager. They couldn't tell us when we would be seated.\\n\\nI imagined a short wait, so we went outside, crossed into a store to wait (since the entrance of this location is so packed, it's impossible to wait at the bar or in the meager seating).\\n\\nAfter 20 minutes we gave up. We went back to PF Chang's and the front office staff still couldn't tell us when we would be seated. I saw open tables.\\n\\nWhat on earth is the point of accepting reservations if you do not honor them?\\n\\nThe food here is good, but certainly not great. We went to a local Thai place and were seated with no problem in 5 minutes. The food was much better, the service was good even in a crowded busy restaurant. Oh, and the local place was a much more reasonable price.\\n\\nWe certainly will never visit PF Chang's again.\"],\n",

This was so so as i thought immediately that lu lu noodles and asian cafe are better.  The fried rice was disappointing and the vegetables tasted raw.   Some good notes were the Dynamite shrimp, plump, juicy, tangy with a small kick.    Sweet and sour chicken was just the same minus the kick. \\n\\nThe service was annoying.   We were there less than 45 minutes and it seemed like our waiter was in a rush to get us out of there.   Constantly asking if he could remove my plate.  I had to sternly say at one point that I will let you know when i am finished.

He brought my girlfriend\\'s father (Don) his unsweetened tea then told him he didn\\'t bring sugar because he asked for it sweetened and then did not understand the concept of sweetening it yourself.

(not in an uncivilized or malicious way, either) After that he must have thought we were terrible diners (I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever been impolite to someone who is currently at work, or ANYONE for that matter) and he showed it by being silent and plopping things down in a passive aggressive way. It was really embarrassing and every time he came by the conversation died.\\n\\nObviously the attitude of one idiot who can\\'t hide his bad day well doesn\\'t really have anything to do with the restaurant.

The food came out quick which was a huge plus considering how busy they were. The calamari was okay. I felt like the strips were cut too thin and we should have received more. The Dan Dan noodles were actually very delicious and flavorful. I really enjoyed them and definitely recommend them. The shrimp was cooked well and was also good.

I do understand how someone looking at a $15 plate of \"Chinese\" food could wonder why he or she is paying more for less than your standard Chinese restaurant, but it\\'s never bothered me. Most of the meals are consistently good, freshly prepared, and full of flavor. Plus, the sauce that your waiter/waitress makes for you is always a nice addition to any meal.

Terrible Experience!!! after waiting over one hour to be seated, we ordered calamari for appetizer which came with a horrible strange salty sauce and salt and pepper mix on the side. then I ordered beef and broccoli and my husband ordered a vegetarian dish with peanut sauce . After a long wait my food came so salty that I could not even eat and as much as I hate to complain but I had to let the waiter know, so he went to get me one with less salt. My husband's dish was OK. then the second one was a bit less salty but the meat had a terrible liver kind of taste which totally turned my stomach. I feel the reason they added so much salt was to hide the bad tasting rotted meat. Very bad experience. Our waiter was kind and sympathetic. ruined my evening out :(\"],\n",

       "  u'Let me start off by saying I have mostly simple tastes, and my favorite lunch spot for Chinese has been the New Dumpling House in Squirrel Hill. But since that restaurant is undergoing renovations, I was forced to try something new.\\n\\nSo... I thought I\\'d try the chain PF Chang\\'s Chinese Restaurant at the Waterfront. Wow, what an unsatisfying mistake that turned out to be.\\n\\nI started with a cup of their Wonton soup. At $2.95 it wasn\\'t too outrageous of a price, the broth had some flavor and there was much more in it than I was used to, including three giant basil (I think?) leafs that covered everything beneath. In the broth were chunks of chicken, two shrimp, some sliced water chestnuts and two \"pork\"-filled wontons. As I said, the broth had decent flavor, but the wontons were thick, doughy and under-cooked, and the chicken chunks were dry, which is amazing since they were drowned in broth! On a scale of bad to good, it was kind of meh.\\n\\nNext came my \"lunch-portion\" order of Chang\\'s Kung Pao Chicken (the dinner portion is $5 more). \\n\\nAt the New Dumpling House, this dish is served with a delectable dark, rich, tangy sauce, which I was really hoping for... Not at PF Chang\\'s. \\n\\nOn my plate I received about 8 quarter-size chunks of lightly breaded and browned chicken, 7 hot Chinese red chili peppers (mostly inedible unless they are diced into a sauce), a handful of blanched, unsalted peanuts, a few sliced scallions, and a bed of the most bland brown rice I have ever encountered. Uncle Ben would\\'ve been ashamed if that stuff came out of one of his boxes.\\n\\nGlaringly, there was NO SAUCE!. None at all.\\n\\nI\\'ve had Kung Pao Chicken in New York City, San Francisco, and even from a hole in the wall in Bethel Park, PA that was much, much better. Never have I had it served in such a bland, skimpy, and overpriced way! The \"lunch-portion\" cost was $9.95.\\n\\nAt The New Dumpling House, I could have a delicious lunch, with soup, entree and complimentary hot tea, and I could leave satisfied with just $8 out-of-pocket -- and that includes the tip.\\n\\nThe service was decent. However, lesson learned. One and done. Never going back to PF Changs.'],\n",

Regardless, it's worth it to get the gluten-free soy sauce (which I buy for myself and I know isn't THAT expensive). When my dish comes out, it's literally just steamed veggies and rice. No tofu, no seasoning or sauce. I ask why there's no tofu and the response is that the tofu has gluten in it. When I ask if there should be any sauce (aka flavor) to the dish I'm informed I could've ordered any other gluten-free dish's sauce to go along with it. Thanks for the info now...yes I'll take the GF beef broccoli sauce on the side. The sauce comes out and it's actually tasty so my food was finally interesting enough to eat, even though now I'm extra annoyed at paying $10.50 for steamed veggies and rice and why the menu made no mention that you wouldn't get flavor or tofu. \\nTo top it all off based on how miserable I feel now, I'm pretty sure the beef broccoli sauce they brought out contained gluten anyway!

The hostess and server were both friendly.  My husband enjoyed a glass of sake, and I had a mai tai that turned out to be delicious.  We split an order of lettuce wraps as an appetizer; they don't custom-make your sauce any more which is disappointing, but they did happily provide us with chili paste and hot mustard to doctor it up ourselves.  His Chang's Spicy Chicken (extra spicy) turned out great, and provided the extra requested heat.  My Orange Peel Shrimp were as good as I'd remembered-- perhaps better because they have some fresh orange slices included as well.  We also ordered a Great Wall of  Chocolate.  If you like  chocolate cake at all, you'll love this one.\\n\\nPF Chang's consistently provides good Chinese in a trendy (but still casual) atmosphere at a decent price, and I'm always a fan.\"],\n",

A few of us ordered the lunch special with soups, my mom had ordered the butternut squash ravioli, and we also got an order of street noodles and started with summer rolls. Everything was great (the street noodles in particular are fantastic), but the service was a bit of a disaster- dishes came out more than 10 minutes apart from each other, a huge mood killer with a big family meal; a few dishes came out dirty; soups didn't come out at all; and our waitress made up excuses and didn't apologize when she had in fact missed some of our orders. We were feeling really ignored and discouraged, until we let Sean know. He took great care of us and went way, way out of his way to make up the experience. I really can't thank Sean enough for making sure we left in a good mood after what could have been a very negative experience.

Just overall quality, atmosphere, and clientele is way better. \\n\\nWe needed a large number of photos printed and my father had decided to go to FedEx. I can only imagine this decision because they're known for print quality. They should also be known for being cumbersome and overcharging. After an hour of struggling with their machines to print, we left. I suggested Target because we were in the area, and I halfway remembered that they used the Kodak app to develop pictures from your phone. \\n\\nAs soon as we get in, it's always a win because pictures are 25\\xa2, compared to 49\\xa2 at their competitor. It was easy to sync up the photo library via wifi to the kiosk with the app. After choosing and modifying all of our pictures, we were given a slip stating our order of 63 pictures would be ready in 15 minutes. \\n\\nWe picked up everything else we needed and checked out, finishing in 7 minutes. By then our photos were done and we checked out at the photo stand, paying less than half of what we anticipated paying at the other place.

Our \"wardrobe expert\" (and I feel terrible because I forgot his name) was incredibly friendly and helpful that I couldn\\'t help but think - WHY DON\\'T THEY HAVE STORES LIKE THIS FOR WOMEN!!?  Someone who helps you - no matter your size or height, finds you the pants that fit your body, the dress shirts, the jackets, etc.  This man was absolutely STELLAR!

       "  u'Let\\'s start this review by saying that when we are at that point, my girlfriend and I will be going to Jos. A. Bank for mine and my groomsman\\'s suits.  Allow me to give you a numbered breakdown of the issues we encountered when renting from Men\\'s Wearhouse to be the groomsmen in our friends wedding.\\n\\n1- They never contacted us after the fitting after saying there would be a followup call.  The other groomsmen and I had to follow up repeatedly to get an answer as to when our tuxedos would arrive and the staff were very short with our honest questions over the phone.\\n2- They sent two of our tuxedos to Homestead when we asked for them to be sent to Ross Park Mall during the fitting.\\n3- When one of us called two days prior to the wedding to ask if our tux\\'s had arrived the guy answering the phone said \"Oh... I don\\'t know\" (insert an awkward, pregnant pause here while waiting for him to say \"Let me check that for you\") he instead said \"Well, I\\'m going to hang up now.\"  And he made good on that promise, and hung up.\\n4- Despite saying we\\'d get a call a few weeks ahead of the wedding to be resized in case one of us gained a few lbs over the winter, this call never came so we basically had to hope that everything fit as it needed to.\\n5- We were at one point informed that MW had our emails on file and that when our tuxes arrived at the store we would receive an email letting us know.  Not a single groomsman received any such email to that effect.\\n6- One of the groomsmen randomly received a black tie while everybody else had white.  Another received no studs.  We discovered this approximately two hours to show-time while relatively far from civilization.\\n7- On picking up my tux I informed the associate \"I\\'ll be unable to get to a Men\\'s Wearhouse for a few days after the wedding, is this alright?\" to which she responded \"Yeah that should be fine\" so when my girlfriend graciously dropped off my tux for me a few days later and learned of the $100 late fee, I was totally caught off guard.\\n8- My girlfriend was also caught totally off guard by the associate at Ross Park Mall who was incredibly rude to her when  he informed her of said late fee.\\n9- As the Best Man I was given a coupon card for $50 off my next rental at Men\\'s Wearhouse.  Since I am in another wedding next month with rentals from MW I figured this would be an opportune time to use it.  Imagine my shock while paying for the next weddings rental, when I presented the coupon and was told \"Oh, that isn\\'t for this.  That is intended for YOUR wedding.  Oh and it expires on December 31st of this year.\" \\n10- The groom himself decided to use a coupon to purchase a suit for the wedding and to own, rather than rent a tux for the occasion.  He was ensured by the Homestead staff that the coupon would be fine for this purpose and got fitted for it.  When he went to pick up his suit and pay with the aid of said approved coupon he was instead forced into an argument with an associate who insisted he could not use the coupon towards the suit that an associate a few weeks earlier had insisted he could use.  Granted, now I am speaking for another person so take that with as much salt as you may, but he reiterated this fact to me several times prior to his wedding last week.\\n\\nOver my friends wedding weekend, any time anything even went slightly wrong at and around his wedding, the joke between the Groom and his Groomsmen was \"Effing Men\\'s Wearhouse.\"  For example, at a restaurant, \"Wait I asked for no onions on this sandwich. - Effing Men\\'s Wearhouse!\"  \"Noise complaint at the hotel room? Men\\'s Wearhouse.\"\\n\\nAnother groomsman looked at me when we discovered the wrong color tie one of us received and said to me \"I hope you\\'re taking notes for your own impending wedding\" to which I replied \"Perhaps I could find better service from GoodWill of Western PA\"\\n\\nCongrats Men\\'s Wearhouse.  You became the butt of every joke for every mishap for an entire weekend around a wedding to which you provided the suits.\\n\\nTL;DR - 10 mistakes, several rude associates and 1 future groom going to Jos. A. Bank.'],\n",

When I walked in I was immediately created by Bill who was warm and friendly. Anna came out to perform the measurements and mark up the suit. She checked everything, even changes I hadn't thought to have made to make sure the suit fits me perfectly when they are done. Best of all, when I asked if they could ship the suits to me at my house since I no longer live in Pittsburgh, they asked when I was leaving town and promised they would get it done for me before I left  the next day. Better yet, they had the suit ready for me early, avoiding the rush for me to pick it up before I left. Everyone was extremely helpful and diligent and I will continue to only get changes done at this store.\"],\n",

       "  u'Let me start out by saying that my husband loves the MW at Westmoreland Mall, and even rented his tux there for our wedding without issue. Last year, he also rented a tux there for an out-of-town wedding he was in. After the wedding was over (the next day, before we returned home), we returned the tux to a MW at the local mall, also sans any issues.\\n\\nRecently, said husband got a promotion and bought some dress pants and shirts from MW at the mall, and was sent a $50 gift card. Last weekend, we decided to head down to The Waterfront....lo and behold, there\\'s a MW in Homestead. Who knew? So, we head to MW to see if he can get something for free. Before we go in, I ask him, how much are pants normally at MW? He said, oh about $50 or $60. Okay, well the cheapest pair of pants we find are around $130, but most around $200?! I\\'m shocked, never thought men\\'s dress clothes were so pricey. Again, who knew? Surprisingly, we were able to sift through the sale racks and were able to find one pair of pants on sale for $19.99 and dress shirts for $14.99! Very exciting! \\n\\nThe problem was the staff and the store itself. First of all, the store was messy. Sales racks had clothes out of place and shirts rolled up, not a good impression for a \\'high end\\' men\\'s clothing store, not to mention it was hard to look for sizes etc. with everything out of place.\\n\\nThe biggest issue was with the staff. There were five employees in the store. Okay, I get it, they work on commission, but seriously. The one and only employee who approached us, and I can\\'t remember her name but she was a middle-aged Russian woman- was a shark! She asked if we need help, we both say no, we\\'re fine. Just looking. I am much more assertive than my husband, however, which she realized right away. Needless to say, she wouldn\\'t leave us alone. I tried several times - nicely - to tell her we were just looking around. My husband said, I\\'m looking for some dress shirts and pants. maybe a tie. She just doesn\\'t get it...keeps asking \"Do you want to look at more ties?\" \"We have nice blazers and jackets\" I\\'m finally like, lady we\\'re only here because we have a gift card, we don\\'t plan on spending a ton of money. Getting her to leave us alone was near impossible. If it would have been me alone, I would have walked out. However, I knew my husband wanted to use the gift card.\\n\\nThe worst part is there were other customers in the store that no one was waiting on. Some of which were looking around for assistance. I didn\\'t get it.\\n\\nContinuing on, check out was a nightmare! Each and every item rang up more than the price tag. She had to end up cancelling the sale and re-doing the whole thing. We had to carefully scrutinize every thing she rang up, to make sure we weren\\'t overcharged. We ended up going over the $50 - obviously. So, she says, \"You can swipe your card there.\" I said, \"We have cash\" and omg you would have thought it was the end of the world. They had no money in the drawer and she actually had to send another employee in the back to get us change. \\n\\nLet\\'s just say, I\\'m sure my hub won\\'t returning here anytime soon. You can buy nice men\\'s clothing almost anywhere else for less money and less hassle. \\n\\nPros: None'],\n",

The Steak Untouchables though not Primantis, is the close runner up for my favorite \"sandwich with everything on it\".  The hoagies are never soggy and this might seem like a small thing but they use shredded lettuce.  I hate when you go somewhere and it\\'s just regular ripped off the head lettuce, not this place.  I do think it\\'s a little expensive but I\\'ve watched the prices go up with the economy and their popularity so I\\'m sure it\\'s justified.  \\n\\nSide tip, go in and get a slice of Pizza, it\\'s a little different than their whole pizzas you order.

       "  u\"I like this Eat'n Park. Even though it is a chain, not all of them are created equal. The wait staff and kitchen staff really make a big difference in whether or not an Eat'n Park is worth patronizing.  Eating here, I change my mentality a bit. I always order the seven dollar BBQ burger with the salad bar add on for two dollars. In my mind, I always see myself ordering the seven dollar salad bar with a two dollar hamburger. When the salad bar is kept stocked, it has some really good and fresh items. I love that they have spinach and not just iceburg lettuce. I wish other Eat'n Parks were more like this one.\"],\n",

       "  u'Yes, I know that it\\'s cheap diner food, but c\\'mon... You have your corporate headquarters within walking distance and this is all you can serve up? \\n\\nMy husband and I were craving a late night snack after seeing a movie a couple weekends ago and decided to try this Eat \\'N Park location for the first time. I had always been adequately satisfied at other locations so I thought this restaurant would be worth a try.\\n\\nI ordered several items - Sweet Potato Fries with Apple Butter Dip, Hot Chocolate, and Pumpkin Creme Pie. I think my husband ordered some sort of burger or sandwich. Anyway, every item was problematic in some way. The fries were good, but the apple butter was oddly thick and sweet. The hot chocolate had \"creative\" chocolate syrup drizzling, that was running all down the cup and saucer. I had to carefully drink the beverage - which was OK - because I was afraid that I would get the syrup all over my hand, face, and clothes. The pumpkin creme pie looked like it was sliced by a 5 year old. It looked like it had been carelessly cut and plopped onto the plate, where it appeared very flat and unappetizing.\\n\\nHowever, our waitress was the sweetest, middle-aged woman! Our food took a little time to get to our table (not too bad though) and she comped two of the items (I believe the Hot Chocolate and the pie) from our bill. She was very attentive and kind while we dined there, and I made sure that my husband gave her a good tip. If I remembered her name, I would definitely mention it in this review.\\n\\nHowever, despite our kind service, I\\'m not planning on returning to this location any time soon.'],\n",

       "  u\"We had a really nice Sunday brunch here today. It exceeded my expectations which were admittedly very low. We needed some healthy food options for our 1.5 year old as well as enough comfort food to satisfy our starving and lazy weekend bellies. \\n\\nThere was a short 10 minute wait for a table at around noon but the hostess was nice enough and they gave us a big, clean booth with a partial view of the river. It took another 10-15 minutes to get service although our waiter did pop by to say he would be right with us. Another waitress took our order in the end and they comped us for one buffet. So the three of us ate for the price of one since kids five and under get a free buffet with a paying adult. ($7.99)\\n\\nOk enough about the service which was slowish but it's a full house at that time so understandable . The food:\\n\\nThe buffet was constantly refreshed and each container overflowing with hot food. My favorites: really well cooked fried chicken perfectly salted and complemented with Frank's red hot sauce. Biscuits and gravy, the biscuits were a little dry, mini peirogies, cooked baby carrots, really nice mini pancakes, stuffing, bacon, and ok-only home fries. It's too bad cos I generally judge a place by the quality of their breakfast potatoes but in this case the fried chicken more than made up for it. My husband had some decent salad and good clam chowda.\\n\\nMy kid ate everything on the other end of the buffet: cherry tomatoes, cottage cheese, cooked baby carrots, cantaloupe and honeydew melon, pineapple, bits of peirogie and chicken. The waiter gave him a shamrock sugar cookie at the end of the meal. We helped him eat most of it :)\\n\\nThere were a few misses: French toast were disappointingly dry and hard and the buttery/oniony noodles were undercooked. Other things looked good but we couldn't try it all: mini-waffles, mash potatoes and gravy, sausage patties, cheesey sauce, scrambled eggs. We'll just have to go again in a few weekends.

My husband and I were riding the bike trail in Pittsburgh and we decided to grab a bite to eat here since this location is right along the trail.  We noticed there were many tables open on the patio so we requested to sit outside.  It was rather busy inside so we waited patiently for 20 minutes until it was our turn to be seated.  The hostess then took us to a table inside the restaurant.  Not wanting to be rude, I asked if they were not putting anyone outside for some reason... She said the person who took our name didn\\'t indicate that we wanted to sit outside (however, I watched her write \"patio\" next to our name).  We were then led outside and told to sit where ever we wanted... Because it was still basically empty... \\n\\nFinally happy to be seated, we waited another 10 minutes or so for our waitress to come.  She asked if we were ready to order both our meals and drinks so we did.  It took another 10 minutes to get our drinks which we quickly drank because we were thirsty from riding.  We were able to get a refill before we got our food since it took over 40 minutes from the time we ordered it.  The waitress came back one more time after we were done eating and I asked it I could talk to someone about how long everything took but she did not seem interested.  No apology.   Nothing.  She simply said that sometimes they aren\\'t told when someone is seated outside.  Maybe that would explain the initial wait but why the terrible service after she clearly knew we were there?\\n\\nThis Eat\\'n Park is a joke.  Extremely slow service and a rude waitress on top of it.  The food was ok, but paying for that meal made me feel like I was being robbed.  A group of people at the table next to us walked out after waiting 10-15 minutes for a waitress to acknowledge them.  Even when a woman at the table asked our waitress if she could order drinks, she just went inside and ignored them.  Whoever manages this restaurant should be ashamed!'],\n",

From the second I walked in the door no one acknowledged my sister or myself for at least five to ten minutes, which I thought was weird because they were not busy. The manager, who was standing close and talking to another employee looked briefly at us, didn't smile or welcome us, turned and continued her conversation. We finally get sat at a booth that the hostess sloppily wiped off, left crumbs all over the seat and left old trash sitting on the table. We sat in the booth for ten minutes waiting for someone to come wait on us before I finally decided enough was enough and left. My sister loves Eat n Park but every time I enter the waterfront store I'm severely disappointed. \\n \\nI've been a manager and a cook at two very busy restaurants in Oakland for over six years so I know what I'm talking about.

       "  u\"We had 20 people so we had our own room. The server Janee started off strong setting a tone for our meal that she would be organized and on point.  Unfortunately, that was the high point of this service.  We sat there for 20 minutes without drinks, in fact some meals started coming out and we still didn't have our beverages.  Half the table had Pepsi or Diet Pepsi, the other half had water and two people had dr. pepper.  I'm not sure why they couldn't just get pitchers.....I got the salad bar only, it was ok but it was messy so when you went to add items other items were mixed in which is kind of gross, I thought the chili was overly salty.  The other people we were with didn't have much good to say about their meals, with the exception of the angus burger.  Janee did stop and take a picture of our whole table which was nice and we were there three hours so she did earn her pay, but she set the expectation high that she knew what she was doing and it fell flat pretty fast.  I'm not sure it was all her fault as she didn't seem to have a staff that was working to support her, just catch her up as needed.  I think if you have 20 people at a table 2-3 staff members would make you more successful.  When we went to leave I bought a dozen of the sugar cookies.  The person at the counter didn't know how to ring them up and was quite rude when I asked for her to ring them up, like I was doing her a disservice by asking to purchase the restaurant's products.

Not many places in Pittsburgh offer these types of views while dining (and that's a Pittsburgh mystery to me). The restaurant is never to crowded and you won't get packed in like sardines in a tin can. So you can enjoy a fairly romantic dinner with your loved one(s).  \\nThe food is very good but you may have to shell out a few clams of your own ($$$). If you have deep ocean like pockets put your hook into the  sea bass which is always moist and scrumptious at around $29.99. They will cook your food one of several ways. I like my fish broiled, their signature is too salty for my liking. Bread is mmmgood and hot (free). Staff is very  accommodating ie you can request to sample a soup and the servers are pleased to do so. I recommend you try their soups like the seafood gumbo. A bowl of this creamy delight goes a long way...bonus they toss in those little hexagonal oyster crackers as  reminds me of my youth on Long Island's south shore (but that's another story). Salads a bit skimpy and somewhat pricey (approx. $7.95 for basic house salad).

Back to mitchell\\'s, I had the iceberg wedge with bacon, egg, tomatoes and a delicious home made blue cheese dressing. I also ordered a bowl of seafood gumbo which was the best gumbo I ever tasted. It wasn\\'t overly packed with rice, as a matter of fact, there wasn\\'t much rice at all. It was mostly shredded crab, scallops, and shrimp with a very delicate broth that wasn\\'t too thick and the heat snuck up on you after swallowing. It wasn\\'t a lot of heat, just enough to make it exciting. As for the iceberg wedge salad, every once in awhile I need a piece of iceberg instead of a bowl of spring mix (ie: tender weeds). The star of this salad was the chef made blue cheese dressing. It was not overly thick, very tasty and savory. It complimented the bacon and egg on the wedge. The cousin ordered the carrot cake for dessert and it was easily a pound slice. I tasted a little bite and must say it\\'s the best carrot cake I\\'ve ever tasted. The cream cheese frosting was more buttery than \"cheesy\", it was a great surprise when you\\'re expecting the normal cream cheese frosting. There were whole walnuts throughout the cake and many raisins, which I love. Also this recipe seems to rely on more cinnamon than I\\'ve tasted in the past. I highly recommend it.

       "  u\"Delightful! After biking on the river trail that led us to the Waterfront, we zoomed past what looked like a wonderful patio situation at Mitchell's, right on the river. We parked our bikes and were seated promptly at the patio. The waitress even filled our water bottles for us! The interior of the restaurant is very nice, sea-themed, and clean. The decor is really tasteful and classy. The outside was perfect. It was Sunday afternoon and the weather was gorgeous. Looking out to a serene part of the river is fabulous as well. Our waiter was professional, knowledgeable and friendly. We decided just on a few drinks and an app. The two drinks my bf ordered were AMAZING. The first, muddled basil, grapefruit juice and vodka (I forget the name). SO refreshing! the basil was flavorful and tasted awesome with the grapefruit juice. The second he got was a frothy pineapple-vodka with a huge fresh chunk of pineapple inside. Both were winners. I stuck with a fairly priced white wine but got to test his fun drinks :) The app we got was the Hawaiian Seared Ahi Tuna and it was delicious as well. It was a pretty decent size to split, and came with sushi rice, a red onion/cucumber relish, ginger and wasabi. I believe the tuna was also drizzled with ponzu. It was so good - definitely recommend! My bf couldn't help himself so he also ordered a cup of lobster bisque, which I don't eat, but he said it was very good. He also polished off some of the warm bread loaf that accompanied our meal. This place definitely earns the stars and I had no idea it was even a chain. The waiter said they were expanding, so hopefully the quality and service don't go down. I also checked out the rest of the menu and they use quality ingredients and the prices really aren't bad (it was the lunch menu - I'm sure the dinner menu is pricier.) I felt like I was on vacation and I'll definitely be back!\"],\n",

The bread they served with the apps was fresh baked (I believe sourdough) and it was quite tasty along with the whipped butter. Our entrees came with house salads - had great elements, but I felt I couldn't enjoy mine because the dressing given was a poppyseed vinagrette and I can't handle too much acidity in my food these days. My fiance however cleaned his salad plate (not a sentence I utter often).\\nENTREES: I had one of the specials, Grilled Shrimp and Scallops with roasted summer vegetables and tomato vinagrette (which I asked for on the side). The seafood part was great - the vegetables were so-so. My fiance had the special of Cod stuffed with Lobster (and some other seafood) with asparagus and a lemony sauce - I had a taste of his and it was really yummy, I'll def order that next time! We both finished our plates, which wasn't too challenging b/c the portions were moderate (I got 3  srhimp and 3 scallops for example) but still filling.\\nDESSERT: Didn't order any\\nSERVICE: Friendly, though a little sparse.

Spotted Mitchell's Seafood and since I never heard of ot before, decided to make it my evening dinner choice - in fact, looked forward all day to a nice shellfish dinner ala Bonefish Grill. They have a nice al fresco patio overlooking the River that I wish I say at.  Place was pretty empty at 8 pm on a Monday night, but that's to be expected. I ordered the Seafood Americana which was supposed to have saut\\xe9ed shrimp and scallops in a light butter sauce. What I got in return was a plate of small shrimp in a brown gravy with NO scallops whatsoever. I immediately returned the dish and the young and nice manager came over to make it right, so I reordered a different steamed shrimp and scallops dish which was much better- 5 larger shrimp and 5 sea scallops over spinach and veggies with a soy sauce on the side - very nice but wish they had drained the ingredients better so they didn't end up on a soupy broth.  Having waited tables in a high end seafood restaurant through graduate school I am tempted to attributing this experience to Monday night, late dinner, inexperienced cooks, and lack of kitchen or server oversight. I hope your experience is better than mine. Too many other good choices nearby to give them a second chance - sorry.  Disappointed.\"],\n",

       "  u\"I took my daughter here for lunch. She had been wanting to come for a good while. She's graduating high school next week so it seemed like the perfect time. She had the clam chowder and the shrimp scampi. It was great. She wished that the chowder was slightly thinner but enjoyed the alfredo-like flavor. I was not in the mood for seafood so I had the bacon cheeseburger. You can't go wrong with a burger right? Well, let me tell you, that was one of the best burgers that I've had and I frequent restaurants who specialize in them. It had a beautiful char flavor to it. I did not need any condiments. The broccoli I had was wonderful as well and I especially enjoyed the seasoning.\\n\\nThe only thing that slightly sullied it for me is that it was too dark. I love atmosphere but I was almost asleep before the food came out.\"],\n",

       "  u\"Went there for dinner tonite. Visiting from out of stat and it's close to the hotel where we're staying. Everyone complaining around us. Took our order quickly. Told they ran out of bread and we could have crackers. Waited a half hour for our food.   Waitress said they were running behind in the kitchen and out of a lot of food. Asked the waitress to check on our food and waited for her to come back and when we saw her serving water to another group, we just left. Poor service and management.\"],\n",

       "  u\"very disappointing.  i have been a patron of this restaurant/location since it opened.....usually dining there about once a month.  my last few visits were fine, not great, but fine.  today was not.  the restaurant was about half full, i was with one other person.\\n     food---  my friend had a ceasar salad:  the staff didn't know where the anchovies were, therefore none.  it was served at room temperature.  chef's special was penne in a light alfredo sauce with crab and shrimp.  it also was served at room temperature.  i had the scallops with stir fried vegetables.  the scallops, too, were at room temperature and only seared on one side, some not at all.  the manager offered to redo the meals, which we accepted.  she shrugged her shoulders and said she didn't know what else she could do.  the scallops were better the 2nd time, penne was watery, crab was all but invisible.  the garnish had cheese on it the first time, not the 2nd.  penne was mediocre at best.\\n     service--- probably the worst service i've ever had there.  our server seemed overwhelmed, apologized continually to us and every other table she had nearby.  maybe that was part of the reason our meals were not hot the first time.  never did get a refill on iced tea.\\n     ambiance--- the place is starting to look tired.  the tables are showing their age.... the surface hasn't been kept up, the finish has long since worn off in the most used parts.\\n\\nsorry to see this place go down hill.  have many memories of better times.  may not ever go back.  looking for a new place in the area.\"],\n",
       " [2,\n",
       "  u'Will not eat here again.\\n\\n1) Waitress (Angela) could not be found for 10+ minutes at a time. The entire meal was a running commentary on where she was and why we didn\\'t even get water refills until dinner came. She had to be specifically asked three times for water before we got our one and only refill.\\n\\n2) Spilled mussel butter on my jacket and although she did apologize no manager ever came over to see if we were okay. When I did complain they offered a $25 gift card which didn\\'t even cover the cost of said jacket, thanks but no thanks.\\n\\n3) When asked specifically if a dessert was served warm the waitress said \"yes, of course\" but spoiler alert it wasn\\'t. Party involved said it was fine and asked me not to say something.\\n\\n4) When asked if they had a very specific after dessert drink the waitress replied in the affirmative only to substitute Irish coffee instead. If you are out of something just own up to it, don\\'t try to pull one over on someone.\\n\\nLong story short - decent if overpriced food, nonexistent management and the worst service I have experienced in a long while. As a server myself I am pretty forgiving but the (non)service ruined a $150 meal and Mitchell\\'s management couldn\\'t care less.'],\n",

       "  u\"After a long but beautiful day touring Pittsburgh and riding the Duquesne Incline we settled down for a late dinner at Mitchell's fish market.\\nWe were seated in a picture perfect spot by the window as requested. Our waiter initially greeted us warmly but the service went south quickly and I trying to wrap my head around - Why?  \\nWhat was wrong with the service you wondered. Well.....\\n*We had to wait a long time for our drinks \\n*appetizers ordered but not received.\\n* Requested bread several times waiter was oblivious to the request \\n* Dinner took for ever it felt like a century later\\n It was good thing we was on vacation so we had time to waste. \\nWe observed the other waiters and waitress was busy attending to their patrons. \\nOn the plus side the food was divinely delicious!  Salmon, scallops- Super fresh and melted in my mouth.  My husband's dish ordered the Shrimp and Crab Cakes and he hummed  yum to every bite he ate.  Unfortunately service and excellent service should go hand and hand.  If only the head manager who was consistently walking around to various tables talking to patrons would have stop at our table we could have given him the scoop about our lack of service.  On well.\"],\n",

I ordered the crab stuffed shrimp and was disappointed.  There were five very small shrimp on the plate.  The shrimp were dry and overcooked.  The crab stuffing was mostly stuffing.  All I tasted was breading.  I didn't see a piece of lump crab anywhere.  The best part of the meal was the bread and butter.  I was with a party of 12 people and I was surprised to see such small portions on the others plates.  For the prices at this place, I had hoped for so much more.  I will not go back.\"],\n",

Well that was an understatement. \\n\\nWhen I arrived to pick up my order, there was class A attitude from the minute I walked in with the bartender. Then I had a total of 5 bags and 2 fountain drinks (which she said she had absolutely nothing to put them in for me), and I asked her if she could help me carry the bags to my car.  Her reply \"no. I have tables I need to take care of.\" \\n\\nI don\\'t expect over-the-top service at this restaurant, but I do expect a smile, a nice and pleasant attitude, along with a little helpfulness.

The clam chowder was perfect; definitely get it. The mussels were delicious--not as firm as mussels usually are (but in a good way) and bigger than normal. The spicy crispy shrimp surprised me; I didn\\'t think it would be good, but it was. Boyfriend said his lobster bisque was \"funky\" and I agreed that it tasted weird, but it was still edible. \\n\\nThe calamari, however, was unseasoned. Maybe they forgot to season it that night? I feel like the way it was served to us is not the way they usually serve it. Also, I was disappointed with the small portion of the calamari. For $12, we should be getting way more than we did. \\n\\nOur server was attentive and noticed that we liked a lot of their appetizers, so she informed us about their happy hour (Monday through Friday 4:30-6:30pm) where their appetizers are at most $7 each! Tempting, especially after our pleasant dinner experience.\\n\\nTaste | 4\\nAtmosphere | 4\\nPresentation | 3.5\\nService | 4\\nOVERALL | 4'],\n",

       "  u\"This is a really hard review for me to write, simply because I cannot for the life of me find the words to explain the food. Lackluster, no, not really...Mediocre...no....Pedestrian/average/common...huh uh. Just 'eh.' It wasn't awful, terrible or even bad, and it wasn't great, good or even fine. It was just....edible, I guess.  \\nWe started with shrimp dumplings from the happy hour menu and the BF got seafood gumbo. I thought the gumbo was decent; he said 'eh', however we both agreed the dumplings were 'eh'. \\nI got something called the market trio, which came with creole style rice, corn, a crab cake, a hunk of salmon and 5 shrimp. It wasn't terrible, inedible food, it was just....not good. And for $28 I wish I would have just gotten a bowl of the gumbo. The only thing that seemed to have any flavor was the rice. The BF got a crab and lobster stuffed cod, which again, was not bad just not good. It had a lemony-buttery sauce, that didn't taste quite lemony or buttery somehow. \\nI know this is a stupid thing to gripe about, but I hatehatehate when restaurants charge necessarily high prices for pop. Soda, cola, pop, call it what you want, but it should never be more than $2.50. I usually just drink water with lemon, but I had a headache, so I ordered a coke. $325!! And having a BF who works for a restaurant, I know that pop costs them pennies! I see $2-2.50; some people drink glass after glass of the stuff, but $3.25 is simply ridiculous. Especially when the food kinda sucks. And I read other reviews and the decor is not classy. It's like it's trying to be classy, but real classy restaurants know its' not classy. It was a little like an over-priced, under-flavored Red Lobster without the kickass cheese biscuits. But when your food sucks at Red Lobster, you can always fill up on the delicious biscuits.\"],\n",

The scallops were perfectly cooked and the flavor of the broth was fantastic. My shrimp were over cooked though, thus the four star review. They got everything right but that one thing kinda tainted it.\\nI had the banana bread pudding for dessert and that was also very good. I've had a lot of bread pudding and this was one of the best. It was light but also dense and the flavor of the banana came through very clearly.\\nOverall I had a very good experience! It would have been very great if it weren't for the over cooked shrimp. I'd definitely go back, but it is pretty pricey.\"],\n",

Yes, it's Old Navy, but I shopped in this store three times over the past week and did not have anyone come up to me while wandering around the outerwear. However, the woman that assisted me in the fitting room had a great attitude, and I really enjoyed interacting with her.\\n\\nOverall, a four star Old Navy experience...

Their selection is poor especially in the snowboarding and biking section. Maybe it's good for small children who want their first snowboard? It is a very average store with average products. I would like to see some attempt to carry more high end products. I am not into fishing or hunting live prey so I am not sure about these departments? I guess if you want some Under Armor products then this is the place to go because I see aisles upon endless aisles of these types of products.\"],\n",

It\\'s mostly low-end youth gear, too, which makes it nearly useless to adults or even some teenage soccer players.\\n\\nThe staff at this location has always been really nice, though, and it\\'s the closest location to where we live, so I still end up going there quite a bit for running and clothing needs (of course, we usually leave empty-handed as they don\\'t have what we\\'re looking for). \\n\\nThey do have quite an extensive fan gear section if you\\'re looking to support the local Pittsburgh teams, but this store just doesn\\'t have the overall inventory necessary to be considered a \"good\" Dick\\'s location.'],\n",

I also found a small child in the back of the store playing dangerously on one of the elliptical machines, which is something that both his parents and the store's staff should have addressed.

And I quickly remembered why!\\n\\nForget the fact that McDonald's food isn't great. We all know it's not great. The problem here is that they added insult to injury by giving you the worst customer service ever in addition to not so good food. For starters, I quickly discovered that the drive-thru here is the ABSOLUTE slowest line on planet Earth. You certainly won't be getting any fast food here! Then, once I FINALLY placed my order, and finally got to the window to pay (because of course I spent a lot of time waiting for the people in front of me to even get their orders), a young woman took my card, swiped it...and didn't say another word. I waited thinking she was printing a receipt - nope! Eventually - after whipping out her phone and sending a text or two - she realized I was still there and told me to go to the next window for my food. Whatever, I figured, forget the receipt; by then I was pretty sure she had moved on to other orders and couldn't print my receipt anyway. On to the next window, where I was given my food and drink...and I proceeded to quickly discover they gave me no straw and for some reason, layered my Big Mac as such: bread, bread, patty, patty, bread. ...seriously, how does one even mess that up? I give one brownie point because the fries really were actually pretty good...but they were not worth the wait or trouble.\\n\\nI concur with the other reviewers: skip this place. Completely.

And then when she came back in two minutes, told her that wasn\\'t ideal, and sent her back out, with instructions to take the second left and try it on a hill.  After she figured out yes, that was the bike, the guy spent at least half an hour fitting the bike to her; he wound up switching out the stem, adding a seat with a little more travel, and getting everything just so.  There was no hurry.  There was no pressure.\\n\\nThe amount of interest that the staff showed in getting each person the just-so fit gets five stars; if you want a bike that fits, it\\'s worth it to browse here.\\n\\nAnd, update: I went out the other day, and asked for a price on a bike costing about 25% of the bike I tooled around on there two weeks ago.  Without batting an eye, and without a hint of bike snobbery, the owner ran off to figure out what it\\'d cost me.  I talked to him about the differences between a double and triple, and he spent twenty minutes explaining the pros and cons, and gave a strong suggestion on the double.  \\n\\nThat said, the price he quoted me was also 10% under the price quoted by another shop on the same exact bike.  I asked for the price of an upgrade to a single part on the new bike, and he quoted me about half the price I expected from doing research on the internet.  \\n\\nCustomer-friendly, well priced, super-high-quality bicycles.  A+++.\\n\\n\\nEdit, 4 years later: \\n\\nGlen, Beth, and the rest of the crew here are still there, and still awesome.  My girlfriend is now my wife.

I think the days of simply bringing your bike in for a quick and relatively inexpensive tune-up and a few fixes are long gone.    \\n\\nThis review is more for the repair end of BBB. In their defense BBB does appear to carry some amazing brands of bike (ie Colnago) that you just don\\'t find anywhere else in Pittsburgh. \\n\\nAt BBB I was charged $250 for a tune up and a few other things. Granted this included installing a sew up tire (which I can understand would cost approx $50), Swapping out a left side (big ring) shifter on my down tube (this should have cost approx. $20 at most) and installing new bar tape (cost of tape $20 and $20 to install?).. SO WHAT\"S WITH $140 FOR A TUNE UP? Well the story goes like this:\\n\\nI bring the bike into BBB prior to the nice weather hitting Pittsburgh in hopes of trying what people have said is a great bike shop and getting my OCLV TREK 5900 ready for the season. Turns out I don\\'t hear from these guys. A week goes by ...two weeks...I think that\\'s ok I have two or three other bike I can turn to for a ride. Then I wind up going out of town for a week thinking for sure I\\'ll get a call from them re: my bike is ready to roll...but no dice. So I call. Turns out a screw snapped when the mechanic was re-installing the down tube shifter and it had to be tapped out (is that my fault?). He says \"Should be ready in a few days\". So I come in a few days later to this mammoth bill. I ask if I am paying for the labor of taping out the screw? I don\\'t think I ever got a straight answer? I look at the bill and can\\'t see a good breakdown of the charges. Normally I would \"duke it over\" a bill like this but I figured...I had somewhere I to be 10 minutes ago and at least I finally have my bike. I would expect that for that money my bike could have been stripped down to the frame and totally gone over (overhauled). But it wasn\\'t.  Well BBB I\\'ll give you a star because the mechanic did do a good job in that my cycle shifts well and the tape job on the bars looks great (nice wrap). Plus I\\'ll toss in a star for your outstanding selection of high end cycles. Maybe I would have rated BBB higher if I was in the market for a purchase instead of a simple repair?'],\n",

Since it was covered under warranty, BBB switched it out for a new set of shifters, at no cost to me.  I had my bike back in a couple days, no muss no fuss.\\n\\nMy husband got a used road bike from Craigslist, and we brought it in for a tuneup.  The bike had several things wrong with it, due to a shoddy assembly job, and BBB basically took the entire bike apart and rebuilt it, cleaning it and replacing various worn-out bits.  I can't remember the total cost of this, but it was under $100.\\n\\nI would totally recommend BBB, due to their general awesomeness.

Having spent time in Europe, and with some of the biggest names in the industry, he truly knows what he's talking about.\\n\\nFurthermore; he's a pleasure to talk to, incredibly friendly and passionate as anything about the sport.  As for bike fitting, this is the only shop I would go to, Glenn's knowledge and background can't be competed with, and he is incredibly thorough.\\n\\nYes, they equipment is expensive, but that's a result of the quality they carry..not them setting prices high.

Glen is very knowledgeable but can be a bit overwhelming, annoying and pushy, I can see how he can be very helpful to the average Joe, but if you are in his shop you should have done your homework, as this place is not walmart, mid to high level product here. I would encourage getting fitted and even buying a bike there, but going back for service is a whole different story.  Same day service is unheard of here, even for the simplest of adjustments, no service is available at all on the weekends.  the first time I took a bike there to have a rear derailer hanger replaced and re-adjusted (I had already purchased and had the hanger) 11 days went by before I returned to pick my bike up after not being called.  I figured it was just a fluke experience and gave them the benefit of the doubt.  The second time. I took a bike in to have a damaged shift lever replaced with a new 7800 pair. I called after 9 days and they said it wold be 2 days more.  when I showed up 2 days later it still wasn't done, it took 2 more following that, 13 days total.

I was helped by Glenn, who, within two minutes, had me sitting on a bike, measuring me and adjusting things, and explaining the physics behind positioning and angles and the difference between the male and female physique on a road bike. At no point did he try to upsell anything (in fact, he didn't even ask me about a budget). He just gave me a few things to think about before I invest in something new.

Big Bang and owner Glenn couldn\\'t have been more patient of all my questions and concerns.  His knowledge is remarkable and he took his time fitting me and explaining the process. He had several bikes I could demo in my size.  After deciding on a model to order Glenn, Craig, and Samson who I had the pleasure of working with, continued to help me through ordering the bike, getting it assembled upon delivery, and taking a significant amount of time going through the bike with me and how to maintain it properly. The shop has an amazing variety of helmets, clothing, and other things that a cyclists might want to purchase.

The crust is on the thin side and ever so crisp on the bottom, while still having enough dough on the edge to provide a nice chewy bit at the end of your slice. The dough itself is flavorful, not too... well, doughy. The sauce is great, and they don't drown the pizza in it. There's just enough cheese; not so much it's an overwhelming grease slick and not so little you can't tell it's there. If you can go while Mama's working, all the better.\\n\\nYou can eat in here; they have four or five booths and generations worth of family photos on the walls. Two of us split a small (8-cut) pizza with one topping ($9) and with our two cans of pop we were out for $10. You can't beat that. And I'd put Bellisario's pizza up against any in the city.\\n\\nI grew up a five minute walk away. My mom loved Bellisario's and I have a lot of fond memories of walking through the alley to pick up a cheese pizza to bring home, my mom being too dollar-conscious to pay for delivery when there were perfectly able-bodied children around to go pick it up. Every time I have a slice, it brings back great memories. But I've had outside confirmation that it really is as awesome as I think it is.\\n\\nIt's a little divey, stuck in the back of an old shopping plaza, but it's perfect.

You really should fast for two days before picking up pierogi from here.\\n\\nOh, but you'll be happy you did. I'm vegetarian, so I only order meat-free pierogi. I'm in love with the saurkraut and the cheese varieties. When you pick up a hot order, you'll get your pierogi covered in with rich butter and sauteed onions. No, I'm serious -- the pierogi are SWIMMING in butter. It's the best thing ever. Everything is packed inside a styrofoam container and a plastic bag, because butter WILL spill out.\\n\\nYou also can order cold or frozen pierogi if you plan to, say, lug them to the middle of the country to enjoy in a far-off city.\\n\\nBesides many varieties of pierogi, you also can get things from the deli cases. Last time, I had some apricot blintzes, a latke and some type of apple turnover thingy. I really hope Pierogies Plus has the blintzes when I visit next.\\n\\nAwesome thing: Pierogies Plus usually has coupons in the Entertainment Book. My best friend and I steal all of the coupons from our families so that I can get a steady stream of discounted Polish goodness each time I visit.\\n\\nThe only downside is that Pierogies Plus often closes for several days around holidays. I totally understand it -- family time is important! -- but that often coincides with my visits (I head east around the holidays mainly because I get an extra day with the fam without having to take another vacation day). I've learned to plan my trips around the Pierogies Plus schedule, though, because I MUST have yummy goodness. A pierogi-less Allison is a cranky Allison.\"],\n",

They were also drowning in butter and onions. Like, serious, serious butter - Paula Deen has nothin\\' on these ladies\\' butter usage. The kielbasa was awesome, too! I also sampled their haluski and it was the best I\\'ve ever had. Tons o\\' butter, seasoned with generous amounts of salt \\'n\\' pepper, and there was quite a bit of saut\\xe9ed onions in the mix, which added even more flavor. \\n\\nA few things to note: They have coupons you can print out on their website, but you must cut them out if you\\'re gonna bring \\'em in and use them! You cannot just hand them the whole piece of paper. If you want to order a special variety, they need 2 days advance notice (check their site to see what the \\'special\\' ones are). They do accept credit cards, with a $10 min. Yes, some of the ladies are not the friendliest, but the food is so good, they can be like that, and you\\'ll still come back for more!

Her parents were Czech and our annual vacations to visit my grandparents were wonderful - filled with family dinners including stuffed cabbage, peirogies, and haluski.  Now that my mother is older and lives alone making things like stuffed cabbage is difficult for her.  I saw Peirogies Plus featured on the Food Network years ago and decided to send my mom an assortment for her birthday.  When her package arrived she called me immediately and said \"Where did you get this food???\".  This is the real deal - traditional, authentic, ethnic food.  The gift I sent took my mother back to her own mother\\'s kitchen.  It\\'s the comfort food to beat all comfort foods - it also takes me back to my childhood all those summers ago!  I\\'m ordering again for my mother\\'s birthday.  The only \"problem\" now is that I have to order enough to include my brothers and sisters who mysteriously show up at my mother\\'s house once the rumor that the package has arrived makes the rounds.'],\n",

Male, female, gay, straight, black, white, young or old...they all suck compared to this Italian-American dude. He is a true artist & even has a mini-statue of Michelangelo\\'s David next to the chair (a very cool reclining chair) for inspiration or as a reminder that you\\'re going to be walking out of there looking like a masterpiece.\\n\\nCalled ahead on rainy Saturday & left with the best haircut I\\'ve had in years. Hip but not hipster, classic handsome good-looking cut. All done with minimal direction from me (take the sides & back in, comb the front forward & give it some height). I went home, inspected his work & it was flawless 360! Not one missed spot (usually, for me, behind the ears), & not one follicle left untended.\\n\\nIncredible attention to detail, very friendly intelligent funny guy (when he was done, he said, \"Well, I\\'ve done enough damage to you...What do you think?\"), good conversation & casual vibes, all for $14...\\n\\nJust. \\nPerfect.\\n\\n#ItaliansDoItBetter\\n\\nI am King of All Bad Haircuts no more.\\n\\n#Freedom'],\n",

Not only was he on a first name basis with almost all of his customers, it seems pretty clear that they have all been loyal for years.  I wandered in here when my (now former) regular guy was closed between Christmas and New Year\\'s, and the awesome old-school charm of the Golden Razor has won me over.  It is definitely best to call ahead for an appointment, but he was able to squeeze me into his busy schedule same day.  I don\\'t actually know how much he charges for a haircut because I just gave him a $20 bill and said thanks - I\\'m assuming from other reviews, though, that he charges around $15 for a regular cut.\\n\\n\"How is the Golden Razor old school,\" you ask?  In addition to Tom\\'s obvious skills and the nice touch of using a straight razor on the back of the neck, there was a self-serve open bar and a stack of Playboys in the corner.  Johnny Walker Red and soda while you wait for a haircut?  Not a bad way to go!\\n\\nDo yourself a favor and check out the Golden Razor - Tom knows what he\\'s doing and all of the other positive reviews are on the money.'],\n",

As I learned from the other people walking in and out, the barber's name is Tom, older gentleman with an Italian accent. He's def from the old country. Very friendly dude with a funny personality. The wait was only about a half hour, which isn't bad at all for a walk in on a Saturday afternoon (I've waited at other barber shops for over an hour and a half when just walking in). \\n\\nAs for the actual hair cut, I'm really satisfied with it. Tom was quick and efficient. I could tell he's been cutting hair for a long time by the way he works. Real quality stuff. I like the fact that he uses a straight razor on the neckline.\\n\\nNo lie, probably one of the best hair cuts I've gotten in a while. I will def be back to see Tom the next time I need a hair cut.\"],\n",

I had made an afternoon reservation and I was in the chair within just a couple minutes of our scheduled time. Tom was pleasant and quick, but not rushed.  I will definitely be going back!'],\n",

       "  u\"I've been going to see Tom at Golden Razor for the past four or five years after a long and fruitless search to find a decent place in Pittsburgh that won't leave me poor. He's not a stylist, so don't go looking for whatever you find in the latest GQ. He is, however, a damn good barber, so if you showed him a picture of what you wanted, I'm confident he could pull it off. \\n\\nTom's old school-- thick Italian accent. He's been at his Bloomfield location since '97 and before that, over 25 years in East Liberty (when the neighborhood was a sh*thole and not the resurgent place it now is).  Tom remembers the regulars by name-- asks how you are, generally remembers what you've been up to, and asks how your family is doing. He does appointments alongside walk-ins. I've never left disappointed in a haircut and have money left over, even after a handsome (and well-deserved) tip. In sum, Tom's place is what a barber shop ought to be: plenty of magazines, great conversation and simple, inexpensive haircuts.\\n\\nP.S. He's busy on Saturday mornings as one might expect. Schedule ahead of time, or enjoy the time just hanging out. Also, cash only.\"],\n",

Tom has paintings on the wall that he painted himself.  He has pictures of his family, kids, and grandkids. He has boxes of toys in the waiting area.  TV is always in the background playing the news.  It\\'s a homely place.\\n\\nI don\\'t know what else to say.  Dude knows how to cut hair and a friendly guy.

The first haircut that got me yelping was good butremember I was king of all bad haircuts at the time so I really had no sense of style back then. Month after month, it all went downhill as the cuts got shorter and shorter, blander & boring-er. \\n\\nAt first I thought he didn't like me but then I saw another young dude get another quick too-short-&-out-the-door cut like mine so I realized it's just how he sees young men's hair. The Dude Just Got Old & Complacent & needs to retire or just cut hair in a mortuary. \\n\\nThis place represents the old world - ignorance, corruption, favoritism, etc. Do yourself a favor & go a stones throw away in lower Lawrenceville to Mister Grooming & Goods to get treated like a king & get an awesome cut for just a few dollars more than this DOA place.\\n\\nTrust me, you'll be glad you did.\"],\n",

However, inside there is a full bar with a restaurant and tables. The food is pretty good bar food and it's a karaoke hot-spot on Saturday nights. The karaoke crowd is pretty diverse and if you are really lucky you may catch Abba singing the Dawson's Creek theme song. Waitstaff is nice as well. 5 stars for the recovery room.\"],\n",

The people who work here are great and surprisingly welcoming to everyone, there's always a nice mix of locals and young people, the beer is cheap, and, okay, the wood walls are kinda awesome.  It's a great place to grab a few drinks with a pal and hunker down in a booth for a low-key evening.\"],\n",
       " [1,\n",
       "  u\"I'm a pretty hard core karaoke fan, so I was excited to visit Nico's on a Saturday night after hearing about their awesome karaoke. Sadly, I was disappointed. The place is rather small and was packed by the time we came (about 10pm). It took ages to get a drink and it's hard to get around the bar with so many people standing around. That said, my drink was nice and strong and the prices are reasonable. \\n\\nNow the karaoke crowd was pretty fun...mostly hipsters with a few good singers but mostly people trying to be funny with their song choice. The karaoke host was just lame. He was an older guy, and seemed rather cranky and jaded, which really kills the mood when you're a karaoke buff looking for a good time. And he had a CD setup -- seriously, CDs, in 2010. His song list was waaaaaay out of date. He had a tiny TV screen that was setup in such a way that if you needed to look at the words, you would be facing away from the crowd. It was just really lackluster in my opinion.\"],\n",

       "  u\"Nico's is one of my favorite Yinzer bars.  I've been going here off and on since I turned 21, even if it was just to stop in for fries at lunch, and it's one of the finest dives around.\\n\\nWe typically stop in here for a fish sandwich and some drinks after the Unblurred gallery crawl in Garfield.  Jason bartends on Friday nights, and he's the best.  He's one of those bartenders that remembers you after your first visit, and remembers what you drink and keeps the refills coming.\\n\\nTheir food is excellent.  The fish sandwich is church-fish-fry good, and the coleslaw is crispy and mayonnaise-d to perfection.  But the real treat of this place is the fries.  There's something about these fries that I just love.  I think they remind me of the homemade fries my grandpa used to make me in his deep fryer when I was a kid.  They're kind of like a thinner, jucy-er version of Potato Patch fries.  Seriously.  Go get some now.\\n\\nAnd like other dive bars in Pittsburgh, the prices are cheap.  This is the perfect place to sit around with your fellow Yinzers and watch the Buccos or the Pens (or both, if it's that glorious time of year when both seasons are going - they have multiple TVs).\\n\\nThe only thing I don't like about Nico's is that it's one of the few smoking-permitted bars left in town (they, like Thunderbird and the Cage, keep the food prices low to skirt that smoking ban loophole).  I've gotten kind of spoiled lately by smoke-free establishments, and I hate coming home stinking like cigarettes.\\n\\nBut the dives in Pittsburgh are all pretty much maintaining the smoking thing, so I can't complain when comparing.  All that said, there's no bar I'd rather hang out at than Nico's.  :)\"],\n",

       "  u\"Bloomfield has some hidden gems and Nico's is one of those kind of places that is getting less and less common around the 'burgh. It's not a gastropub, it's not bohemian, Nico's is just an old time bar/restaurant that makes me nostalgic for a time before I was even born. \\n\\nI always come here on Monday nights for the wing special. It's something like 24 wings for 8 bucks which is not a bad deal. There are definitely better wings around the city, but I still keep coming back to Nico's. Maybe it has to do with the friendly atmosphere (seems to be a family run place), and the divey feel. The location is great as it just pops up in the middle of a residential section in the heart of Bloomfield.\\n\\nThe patrons are always friendly, and on more than one occasion I've had random people start chatting me up like we've known each other for years. If you are feeling adventurous try out karaoke night on Saturdays, its always good for some laughs and fun times.\\n\\nLong live the old school joints in Pittsburgh, I hope you last forever.\"],\n",

Wednesdays are pizza and a pitcher -- we LOVE the Chili Pie and pair it up with Yuengling or the similar.  And the other food is pretty good too -- among our other favorites: the wings, Nico's Platter, and fried cheese.  YUMMY!\\n\\nJason and Nicole who both bartend and wait tables are both AWESOME, always friendly, always generous with the booze, and always quick with a smile.  They're great!\\n\\nPS -- As a reply to reviews complaining about the guy who does karaoke: if they reviewed prior to early 2011, there is someone else there now and we think he's pretty great.  :-)  If he doesn't have a song that you want, let him know, as he's constantly adding new music and updating his collection.\"],\n",

Generally in the late afternoon/early evening it is pretty quiet, with a handful or two of regulars.  A reading group that I am in frequently meets here around happy hour, and there are always plenty of tables and we can talk easily without having to yell.  Weekends it can get pretty crowded, although I've never seen it so packed that I had to wait more than a couple of minutes to grab a bartender's attention.  Karaoke on Saturday nights is a blast, with a great mix of working class, hipster, and trendy all belting out cheesy tunes.

I know it's not everybody's cup of tea, but there is no funner night that grabbing some pitchers with a group of friends and making a fool out of yourself behind a mic.

On my most recent visit, I picked up a 2 foot hoagie for $6.99, mostly because it was a great deal but also because sometimes I want someone else to make me a sandwich (and they used those good meats and cheeses from their deli).

The most crowded section of the store is the deli counter, where you can obtain not only meats and cheeses, but a variety of made-to-order sandwiches and sides.  If you visit the deli counter during peak hours and are feeling indecisive, take a number right away--trust me, you'll have plenty of time to decide what to get as others are being helped.\\n\\nAs for the grocery products, there is enough variety that you can find several versions of most Italian ingredients you'll need here, as well as other general grocery items like milk and ice cream. In general, prices are very reasonable-- generally less expensive than Groceria Italiana.  Unlike Groceria Italiana, a good portion of the product consists of commercially-available brands--albeit many that you wouldn't encounter in a mainstream grocery store like Giant Eagle. Having said that, the main attraction for me is the made-in-house items, such as the fresh pasta, the sauces, and the biscotti, as well as the hot meals.\\n\\nIn the interest of brevity, here is a list of products I've bought at Donatelli's, followed by price, recommendation, and comments:\\n\\nGrandma's plain sauce ($3.65): Recommended--Better flavor and seasoning than commercial jarred sauces (e.g., Ragu, etc.)  Also, I like that Donatelli's makes meatless red sauce, unlike Groceria Italiana, since I don't eat beef.\\n\\nLobster ravioli ($9.99): Not recommended--After following boiling directions (necessary to avoid curdling cream sauce via baking), pasta was good, but filling was mushy.  Also, included imitation crabmeat, and I'm not a fan of imitation foods.  I'll be sticking to Groceria Italiana's handmade ravioli from now on.\\n\\nRicotta pie ($5.49): Recommended--Though this was my first time trying it, I was favorably impressed with the flavor and texture.\\n\\nBiscotti ($3.52): Recommended--I've only had the spumoni biscotti (a flavor I haven't seen elsewhere), but it tasted fresh and was good.\\n\\nItalian bread ($1.50): Recommended--Soft and fresh, and inexpensive\\n\\nHot food from deli counter: Recommended--I had the half pound fish sandwich ($2.49) and a half pound of the white cheddar bake ($2.99), and both were very good.  Notably, the roll was proportional to the fish, so the sandwich didn't fall apart, as is common at other PGH eateries serving fish sandwiches.\\n\\nDespite how hectic Donatelli's can be during peak hours, I've been impressed at the friendly service that I've received at the deli counter and checkout.  If there's one drawback, it's that waits at both counters are inevitable during these times.  Of course, if your schedule permits, this problem can be avoided by simply visiting at non-peak times.\\n\\nWhile Donatelli's may feel kind of cramped and may not seem as immaculately clean as some big box grocery stores (at least for the section the customer sees), this is part of its charm as a neighborhood ethnic grocery store.  I'll definitely continue stopping in for certain Italian grocery items, such as the plain sauce, biscotti, and bread, as well as for inexpensive, delicious hot lunch items.\"],\n",

She cannot snap her fingers so that your meal magically will appear in front of you.  She is the only person that I have ever seen working in there and you will definitely need time to wait and wait for your food.\\n\\n Her cooking area is quite small.  Trust me you do not want to question her about where your meal is or how much longer it will take for you to get it.   Jeanie does swear like a sailor, but in a quiet mild manner and NOT like a raging lunatic.  When you come here you will have to except every swear word constantly flowing from her mouth.    Trust me I  hate it with a passion when people swear, but with Jeanie, it is okay.\\n\\n But with Jeanie, you have to know it is coming and it will be coming in full force.  However while Jeanie will swear like a sailor she greets everybody with a kind and sweet heart.  She will make your order the way you want it.  Beware!!!!!  The portions are huge!!!!!   The coffee is endless. The prices are very reasonable. \\n\\n So why only four stars when it should really be a five.

       "  u'D\\'Amico\\'s is like...Olive Garden, only less festive and with more \"local color.\"  We came here for a coworker holiday dinner at 530 pm on a Thursday.  We made a reservation for seven of us, but there was no need to call ahead - the place was empty except for a man sitting at the bar, and a couple of girls at another table across the room.  Definitely not hoppin\\'.  The color of the walls and the decor remind me of a hotel restaurant that only serves a breakfast buffet.  It\\'s very quiet in there, except for the low noises from a TV showing a football game in the next room.\\n\\nOur server was definitely \"set in her ways,\" as one of my coworkers said.  She had a routine in terms of when she took drink orders, when she took food orders, when she brought the check.  Deviations in the schedule seemed to cause a \"does not compute\" response across her face....like when I sat down and she asked what I wanted to drink.  I said I was going to wait until my next coworker arrived (thinking she might want to share some wine with me), and she was just like \"...you want to wait?  to order something to drink...?\" and I was all \"yes, I just got here....I don\\'t even know what I want!\" and she looked so confused, like how could some idiot like me possibly not know what they wanted to drink - finally she was like \"oh, do you need a list or something?\"  I know, I\\'m one of those difficult customers who requires a wine list in order to determine what wine I plan to order.  I\\'m weird like that.  Trying to order food at the same time as drinks was also a no-go.  You have to play by her rules.  When we did figure out the complicated drink-ordering situation, my coworker and I enjoyed our half-carafe of chardonnay.  I\\'d recommend getting a half carafe - the wine glasses are so small, paying $6 for a glass is a total rip off.  Get a half or full carafe and get your money\\'s worth.\\n\\nThe entrees come with soup and salad, which seems really old-school and kind of awesome to me.  They had one kind of soup, so you get what you get.  It was a chicken-vegetable-tortellini soup served in a little cup.  I liked it, because I like thin, brothy soups, but it wasn\\'t anything special.  The four little tortellinis floating around were the best part, and it was nice to have some veggies too.  Salad was standard iceberg lettuce, carrot shreds, some tinny-tasting black olives, and the acidic but not-bad strawberry vinaigrette that came on the side.  I didn\\'t bother with the bread - it didn\\'t look like anything special and it just came with butter packets.\\n\\nI got the pasta roll for my entree.  Despite having lots of ingredients (pasta, spinach, prosciutto, pine nuts, sambuca, tomato cream sauce, probably some cheese somewhere), the dish was surprisingly one note.  I didn\\'t think it was well-seasoned - I ended up pouring red pepper flakes on top to give it a zing, which didn\\'t help terribly.  The texture was good, and it was a cool idea, and it wasn\\'t a BAD dish, but it was just...meh.  Nothing exciting.  Very average.  Pretty bland.  I tasted a few other people\\'s dishes and my response was the same.  It\\'s just generic stuff.  Like I said, Olive Garden, only local.  Considering how \"meh\" the food was, I think it\\'s way overpriced.\\n\\nSo I wouldn\\'t go back.  It\\'s not my kind of food, or place.

This place is a hole-in-the-wall with a very brusque owner/waiter and kind of dingy decor.  I don\\'t mind any of these things actually, but the food I definitely took some issue with.  I ordered a tofu-veggie dish (can\\'t remember the name) served over rice.  My boyfriend ordered the pork rice vermicelli bowl.  Our food came fast enough and it was served hot.  However, my dish was nothing to brag about.  It was pretty average tasting Asian fare.  It didn\\'t taste bad by any means, but not restaurant quality.  Good thing it was only about 6 bucks.  My boyfriend\\'s dinner was a real disappointment, however.  My favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Seattle had HUGE vermicelli bowls with absolutely fresh lettuce and onions, piled high on top of perfectly cooked noodles.  The meat/tofu you ordered with it was never sparse and it was cooked to perfection.  Everything was doused with some sweet fish sauce and presented with some sliced egg roll.  The pork vermicelli that came to my table did not resemble this at all.  It was served in a rather small bowl with just a few pieces of lettuce and onion.  The \"pork\" that was on top amounted to about 1/4 of a cup of weird texturized, shredded something.  It almost looked like boiled ground beef.  I felt sorry for my boyfriend because he had never eaten Vietnamese food before and I had recommended a vermicelli dish to him because they are (usually) delicious.  As a double whammy, his dish was about 9 dollars!  Neither of us were full when we were done with our meals, so we ordered some spring rolls, which were supposed to be what they are famous for.  I don\\'t understand this either.  The rolls were extremely bland and chewy.  The sauce that was served with it didn\\'t do much to save it.

That\\'s it.\\n\\nIf you\\'ve had Pho in other cities, you might not understand Tram\\'s.  There\\'s no Vietnamese community in Pittsburgh, so you can\\'t get all the trimmings you might have come to expect:   no tripe, no tendon, no other strange meat parts. Just beef or chicken.

I have eaten Pho all around the US, and Tram\\'s broth is, in my view, the very best I\\'ve had.\\n\\nSo get the pho (or, if you\\'re in the mood for something different, the Saigon Soup), get the spring rolls, and skip everything else on the menu.  Then you\\'ll understand Tram\\'s.\\n\\nIncidentally, the owner\\'s name is not \"Tram\".  His name is Le Thao.

And this has been the case a few times before my story tonight.  I\\'ve never minded.\\n\\nTONIGHT though...i went to get some take out pho on a snowy evening.  I had to wait for a few minutes...and the owner was nice enough to engage me in conversation while I waited.\\n\\nI get my Pho...paid..and I get in my car...and drove away...\\n\\nA block later, due to the snowy weather and my inability to slow brake...I squealed to a stop when some guy ran out into the street.  I did stop in time, spared his life...BUT MY PHO WAS EVERYWHERE!  Most of it was in the bag, but a good portion was on the floor...on the seat...MORE IMPORTANTLY, NOT IN MY BELLY.  So I drove into a parking lot...had to dispose of the mess...and cried.  \\n\\nNow not only did I NOT have pho...my car now smelled enticingly of beefy broth.  So in a moment of frenzy, I thought...What the heck...im only a block away, IM GETTING MY PHO.\\n\\nSo I went back...and got my pho!  AND...the guy didn\\'t even charge me.

       "  u\"I do have a special place in my stomach for Tram's kitchen and I try to eat there every now and again.  Pho is a good meal to warm you up in the winter and this place is a great place to stop in for a yummy dinner.  I have been a little wary to go off the beaten path of the spring rolls and the Pho, so I got the spring rolls and the chicken peanut soup (I think that is what it was called).  It was very close to the chicken Pho, except it had less noodles, more veggies, and a little different twist on the sauce with some crunched peanuts that settled at the bottom and a bit more spice.  The dishes definitely didn't disappoint.  The parking is on the street (which is usually pretty empty after working hours), and the ambiance seems to have perked up a little bit with what I think is a new coat of baby blue paint and some new flowery table cloths.  Don't worry though, the mother of pearl wall art is still there, and your chances of not understanding your server is still high.  The prices are cheap, the grub is good, and the place is uh... rustic, oh yeah, and bring cash!\"],\n",

I was expecting to see many different types of PHO on the menu, but there was only one line with PHO on it.  This made it easier for me to make my decision even though the vermicelli bowls were tempting.  I also ordered two spring rolls.   The spring rolls came out and they were much bigger than i was expecting.  They tasted fresh, crunchy and filled with goodness such as shrimp, pork, noodles, and herbs.  I dipped them in a chili sauce as well as a brown sauce to complete this delicious experience.  The only negative of my meal was I ordered chicken and shrimp pho and ended up getting Beef pho.  I am guessing i confused the server/owner while i was ordering.   I didn't bother to complain since i figured he wouldn't understand anyways, so i began to consume my pho.  Every aspect of the dish was perfect from the noodles, to the beef to the sprouts that I got to dunk in every so often.  My meal ended up costing $14 without tip and was worth every penny.  By the time I left every table was filled.  Cant wait for our next February Tropical Storm.\"],\n",

The broth was incredible- ridiculously hot (temp) with onions, just the way it should be.  The beef was probably too well done for my taste and was cooked all the way through when the soup was brought to me.  But it tasted just fine.

       "  u'Was craving Pho while in Pittsburgh - and so on to Yelp I went and found the reviews for this place. So off I went in search of Tram\\'s.\\n\\nTram\\'s is located in a section of Pittsburgh that is a little on the run down side - the area has seen better days. But that did not phase me - adds some character to the place!\\n\\nIt was about 1:45 pm when I rolled in. Was given a choice of where to sit  - a little old man with one arm (or perhaps he was missing just the hand? - could not tell) took my order. He did not seem to friendly - I asked him a couple of questions and it was hard to get anything out of him.\\n\\nI ordered Pho Ga with white meat (although their menu lists it as \"Pho Hanoi\") with garden rolls and a glass of water.\\n\\nI suspected that perhaps their approach to Pho was going to be more Northern Vietnam based on the name for the soup - and I was partially correct. When the soup came out - the noodles were the slightly wider ones rather than the very thin ones.\\n\\nNow I\\'m guessing that many of my Yelp friends from the DC area that like Pho would not have liked the Pho here.  Unless I\\'m mistaken - most of you folks seem to prefer to have all of the fat skimmed and strained out of your Pho broth - which I am against. It makes the broth to clear and light and there is a significant reduction in flavor and richness when this is done. And they certainly weren\\'t doing that here. In fact - there was a slight oiliness or greasiness to the broth - but not overly so. It gave the broth a delicious richness and subtly in flavor that was just so damn good!\\n\\nI added all of the aromatics and veggies. I will say that the amount of Basil, and the quality of the Basil were the low points of the meal. The poor Basil had seen better days.\\n\\nI then tasted the broth and was floored by how good it was. I detected light, rich hints of star anise and cinnamon, which when combined with chicken essence fat globules and onions - was just outstanding. Rich, savory, wonderful!\\n\\nI added Sriracha sauce to individual bites of food as I went - and only added a little to the broth at the very end. I really wanted to savor the broth the way it was.\\n\\nCons:\\n- The rolls were not very fresh - in fact I did not finish them because they weren\\'t very good.\\n- The Basil was not crisp and fresh\\n- The restrooms need to be gutted and retrofitted\\n\\nSo I\\'m only docking them one star for the cons - the Pho was outstanding IMHO - so four stars overall!\\n\\nCash only - no credit cards. I had a bit of a hard time finding parking - so beware of that.'],\n",

The other dishes are usually well made and well seasoned.  \\n\\nI enjoy the short menu and the waiter who is fun to interact with.  This place is usually pretty busy even on a weekday evening.

The spring rolls are excellent, too.  I just wish they served 33 beer to go with it all.  \\n\\nService is good, if a bit gruff.  Don\\'t screw around chit-chatting at the table when you come in; you need to be ready to order when the waiter (Tram?) gets to you.  Failure to do so will expose you to his withering scorn.

In the ancient era B.C.H. (Before Coming of Hipsters), Tram\\'s still did a brisk business serving tasty if basic Pittsburgh-Vietnamese cuisine (they\\'ve taken the shimp curry over french fries off the menu, but you can still order it) to those who would brave the wilds of Lawrenceville (a distinctly unfashionable address, circa 1995) to get it. Did Tram\\'s have all but a corner on the market at the time? Sure. Would people return if it was terrible? I would hope not. \\n\\nAs for the food, I am no student of Vietnamese cuisine, but the bun, or as it\\'s billed here: \"grilled meat (why they don\\'t just call it pork is a mystery, perhaps they\\'re leaving their options open?) over vermicelli\" (pronounced \"ver-miss-eh-lee,\" by our esteemed host) is tasty and filling, as are the spring rolls. I can\\'t comment on the pho as I have had too many inedible-mystery-tendon experiences at \"real\" Vietnamese restaurants in \"real\" cites to \"really\" be all that excited about the dish... \\n\\nLong lives Tram\\'s!

       "  u\"I didn't care too much for the atmosphere because most hole in the wall sort of restaurant are authentic & non-Americanized (which is what I'm looking for).  Location of the restaurant was in a run down (kind of Old Pittsburgh style) and parallel parking was a must, be aware that you may have to park far and walk to the restaurant if you're not able to get front door service.  Inside I didn't expect much, tablecloths were vinyl and chairs with uneven stands.  All I care about was the authenticity of the food & cost for what it's worth.\\n\\nI started my meal with an appetizer of Goi Cuon with shrimp.  I was highly disappointing when disecting what was in it.  There was 1 shrimp cut in half lengthwise, mainly bun (rice noodle) for fillers along with a few strands of beansprouts & lettuce to make it look presentable.  I quickly devoured the tiny appetizer in 2 bites.  My main entree was Pho Ha Noi.  It took forever for the food to arrive, it was a big bowl.  Until I stirred it around to find out it was mainly broth and green onions.  The broth was flavorless, actually it didn't have any flavor; so I had to add hoisin sause to give it a little of whatever to go along with the sliced pork.  I was confused about the noodle itself, Pho is usually served with flat vermicelli noodle; but this Pho Ha Noi was served with round vermicelli noodles usually for Bun Bo entree.  I asked the old man with the amputated arm, why it was served with bun (round rice noodle) instead of pho (flat rice noodle) noodles, he laughed and insisted it was pho (flat rice noodle).  Ok I may be young but I wasnt born yesterday, I think I know my pho noodle and sorry it wasn't.  \\n\\nNext visit to the 'burgh, I think I'll try Pho Minh & see how their PHO compares to Tram's Kitchen.

But there's no reason to order anything but the Pho.  There are many options, but keep it simple.  Pho real.  It's unbelievably tasty and filling.  One bowl will have you stuffed, but if you have a massive appetite, the spring rolls are also huge and delicious.  \\n\\nPrice: One person can gorge themselves with tip included for under $10.  The prices here are ridiculous considering the quality and quantity of the food being served.  If you're on a budget, this should be a regular stop.  It should be regardless.\\n\\nDrinks: the Thai iced tea is good, all regular drinks are offered, no booze\\n\\nAtmosphere: If Tram's was to be criticized in any way, surely this would be it. The dining room is almost but not quite dirty, and likely hasn't changed in 10+ years.  What some may see as a blemish others may view as character (me).  Hey it's Tram's Kitchen, and we're just eating there.  Wear a blindfold, you'll still taste the remarkable food.  Cash only.\\n\\nService: A waiter will be to your table with water before you even hit the seat, and another will be over for your order within 60 seconds.  Thats why you just order the pho.  There's no wasting time at Tram's.  Sit down, order, food comes quick, bill shortly after, eat, go home.\\n\\n(+): Tram's is a can't miss restaurant in Pittsburgh.  The only way to miss it would be driving past it without realizing because its so small and indistinguishable on Penn Ave.  The food and price are unbeatable.\\n\\n(-): Some may be slightly turned off by the atmosphere.\\n\\nWould I go back again? Routinely.\"],\n",

       "  u\"I've been to Tram's Kitchen a few times with friends and I hear good things from people about this place.  Personally, I don't see what is so special about it.  It's kind of a hole-in-the-wall kind of place, but the food is what I expected walking in.  Spring rolls are not flavorful and has too much minced meat and not enough of veggies for a good balance.  Also, I suspect they are the frozen variety and are not made in house.  Summer rolls are meh....  They're big, but again nothing special.  I've had the pho here and once again Pittsburgh disappoints me in the quality of pho that it has.  At Tram's, the pho bowl is small.  I don't expect a huge basin-size bowl, but a bowl of pho needs to have enough noodle, broth, herbs and spiced.  The meat is too overcooked for pho tai (pho with thinly sliced beef steak that is supposed to be cooked only when the boiling hot broth is poured in the bowl).  The taste is reminiscent of pho but isn't quite right.  You need to want to take your bowl and drink all the broth at the end of the meal and you should feel satisfied and be in a comatose state after a good bowl of pho.  This wasn't it.  \\n\\nThat said, the service is nice.  However, I didn't feel too comfortable/relaxed eating here.  It was dark and crowded (and a little bit dingy).  I prefer dining at Pho Minh to satisfy my Vietnamese cravings.\"],\n",

I was walking down the street after visiting my nephew at Children\\'s Hospital.  The food was so good. I had the spicy prawn dish the only thing I would change would be to order two servicing. The \"prawns\" in the dish obviously weren\\'t prawns but fairly large sized shrimps. The sauce was the best it had a really good spicy chilli flavor. I also had the lemon grass tofu.  For a fan of tofu I think it would have been enjoyable the tofu was tender and well seasoned. I am trying to find an opportunity to get back to eat at Tram\\'s Kitchen.

       "  u\"This is one of the best secrets of Pittsburgh. By far the best Pho in the area and over many places I have visited. If you want good service & environment, you'd better stop here. It's a hole in the wall by a seemingly angry asian (he's actually quite nice). Expect to wait on water or wait on refills. If you make your order too complicated, it'll probably get messed up.\\n\\nWith that, the Pho. It's amazing and I've had a lot of Pho. However, it has it hit and miss days too. The meatball is more tender and flavorful than the beef which can be dry or tough to some that haven't had Pho before. I wouldn't recommend any other versions. A small is available as most Americans I bring here are unable to finish a bowl.\\n\\nSpring rolls are great (cold/fresh) with a peanut dipping sauce. The egg rolls are just amazingly full of flavor (fried) with a fish style dipping sauce. Place is very inexpensive too. Oh, this place is BYOB in terms of alcohol. Forgot to mention it's cash only.

The pork was so dry and tough it was inedible for me (though the bf ate all of his). The egg rolls were okay but just not the kind I'd sell at a restaurant. The spring rolls were edible yet I have to say the worst I've had (even I make way better ones). \\n\\nThe waiter/owner(?) is really sweet, and I feel a bit guilty for not supporting the restaurant but I'm sure those that love this place will keep it going strong.

An instant bonus star for being extremely vegetarian friendly.  \\n\\nMy date and I split tofu spring rolls which were fresh, delicious and went well with the peanut based sauce provided.  For the main course I had tofu vermicelli which was by far the best item of food I\\'ve had since I\\'ve moved to this city.  With generous amounts of tofu, vermicelli and whatever coconut based heavenly sauce they put in it, it\\'s hard not to finish an entire bowl.  Throw in some Sriracha and garlic hot sauce and It\\'s almost too good to be true.   For desert we split an order of \"banana cake,\" which sounds kind of stupid, but is actually incredible.  I have no idea what they put in it--maybe a rice based cake, with some beans cooked in, topped with coconut banana cream with sesame seed garnishing?  Really though, who cares?  You just accept it for what it is and eat because it\\'s delicious.\\n\\nAll of this food for two people with prompt service for $25.  How could you not give this place 5 stars?

Now I was impressed! Specifically with the version doused in coconut milk--I love coconut anything, and on top of vermicelli noodles with a squirt of hoisin and sriracha, it was heaven.

Onions and broccoli just aren't my jam, and my favorite veggie to have with my bun, cucumber, was sadly MIA from Tram's version.\\n\\nI do consider myself to be a little bit of a fresh spring roll connoisseur (ooookay, maybe not, but I eat them a lot), and Tram's are good, but not my favorite in the city.

       "  u'If you grew up in a part of the country with lots of Vietnamese food or have eaten it in such places, you\\'re not going to be impressed by Tram\\'s.\\n\\nI gave this place two tries and was disappointed both times. I will admit that I only tried the pho and a vermicelli bowl (on separate trips), but having ordered anything else on each of my trips would have put my bill in the neighborhood of $12+. Having grown up with cheap Vietnamese food in Texas, I wasn\\'t prepared to spend that much for what\\'s supposed to be a budget lunch, even with the understanding that I was going to leave hungry and that the lack of non-European ethnic diversity in Pittsburgh is going to automatically make things more expensive.\\n\\nEither way, I don\\'t understand the hype surrounding this place. The pho bowl was small, with a tasteless broth and child-sized portions of noodles and meat. After a few bites, I drenched the whole thing in Sriracha just to give it some flavor and to try to trick my stomach into feeling a bit more like I had eaten something.\\n\\nThe vermicelli was not so great either--a small portion of vegetables and noodles with a few too-thick chunks of pork that were not grilled long enough for any sort of darkness or crisp (but which still managed to be dry). The color of the dish was as bland as the taste.\\n\\nAs for the atmosphere, not a big deal for me. The restaurant is small, with minimal seating and some dinginess to it, but that\\'s fairly common for older Vietnamese restaurants. Most diners are young, hip, and not Asian (which could be a turn-off for some due to the perceived lack of authenticity and/or hipsteriness). Parking is a chore; if you live nearby and choose to give the place a try, walk or ride your bike, or prepare to find yourself circling nearby blocks of permit-only parking.\\n\\nFolks who dine at Tram\\'s should keep in mind that cheaper, better, more authentic Vietnamese food exists out there. I grew up in North Texas (Dallas-Fort Worth area), where with one of the largest Vietnamese populations in the country, good, cheap Vietnamese food can be found all over the metro area. Pho portions down there are reasonably big, there are plenty of different meat combinations, and you can almost always choose the size of the bowl you want (usually kid\\'s, small, large, and extra-large). Additionally, due to the presence of plenty of fresh ingredient suppliers and competition, prices are more in line with portion size, and the food is, more often than not, good. Most folks with normal appetites are able to leave satisfied having spent no more than $7 or $8 a person with tax and tip (compared to $20 at Tram\\'s). Out of all the Vietnamese spots in North Texas that I\\'ve tried, my absolute favorite is Pho Pasteur, in Arlington: The pho, vermicelli bowls, crushed rice dishes, spring and egg rolls, and prices are all excellent. Tram\\'s would be put out of business if anyone ever opened a restaurant like that up here.\\n\\nIf none of the other few choices in Pittsburgh are satisfying your Vietnamese food cravings, it might be worth it to take a weekend trip up to Toronto. You would also have access there to some other Asian foods that we don\\'t have here, such as dim sum and Taiwanese \"small eats.\" For a slightly shorter drive, you can also find these things (though more sparsely) in the D.C. suburbs.'],\n",

I enjoyed the fried egg roll way more, but I wouldn't discourage someone from trying Tram's fresh spring roll.\\n\\nFor dinner, I had the Vermicelli noodles with coconut milk and beef. It was sweet and savory, but it missed a kick of spiciness to counter the coconut milk. I asked the staff for crushed red chili pepper flakes, but there was a significant language barrier which impeded me from conveying my request. Eventually, I said pepper enough, and I was brought jalape\\xf1o peppers. Not quite what I was looking for but they were an acceptable alternative.\\n\\nThe only subpar point of the night was the difficulty with service.

       "  u\"I stopped by here this past Wednesday evening for dinner with my fiance.   We have both been to Tram's before but it has been awhile since our last visit.  Whenever we walked into the restaurant we saw that not much has changed except for maybe the addition of a flat screen TV.  The restaurant itself is small and maybe has seating at tables for about 30 people and the decorations are a little sparse.  The easiest thing to see is that they have won a ton of awards which are hanging up on the back wall.  Beyond that it is still a hole in the wall divey type of place that is cash-only with excellent food.  \\n \\nAlmost immediately after we sat down the owner asked us if we were ready to order.  At that point we were not ready.  The menu here isn't that big but it doesn't need to be since what they do make is very good.  About two minutes later the owner was back and ready to take our order.  This time we were ready.  My fiance and I decided to split some eggrolls and then for my entree I went with the beef vermicelli with conconut milk.\\nThe eggrolls came out at the same time as the meals and were so hot temperature wise that both my fiance and myself left them until after we had eaten our entrees.  My vermicelli ended up being really good with the sauce providing the perfect flavor to the dish.  I don't know how they do it but they do a great job of infusing a ton of flavors into it.  The noodles in it were also good and the beef was better than expected.  After I had finished my vermicelli I ended up grabbing my eggrolll which was still somehow hot.  While the flavor on it wasn't that great, what I really loved about it was the textures that it provided.  It was cooked perfectly and so the shell had a great crispy exterior while the interior with the vegetables had a softer texture.  Overall it was another solid meal at Tram's for me.\\n \\nThe bottom line for me is that I will definitely be back here again in the future.   Whats not to like about a place where the food is not only cheap but also delicious?  Just be careful in that it is cash only and I know at one point they were BYOB although I am not sure if that is still the case.\"],\n",

We always start our meal with the fresh spring rolls - we both order two each because we don't want to share. Their hoison dipping sauce recipe includes special peanut ingredients that make it unlike any other that other Vietnamese restaurants serve. For dinner, I always order number 17 with no noodles because I substitute extra vegetables. It's always perfect. It's always delicious. I can't find this particular dish at any other Vietnamese restaurant so I continually find myself ordering the same thing. The pho is also delicious but I often times will share half an order with somebody else so I can get my number 17 :-)\\n \\nThe owner is a little abrupt but very friendly and you can bring your own bottle of just about anything and they will open it and serve it for you at no cost.

I ordered both which were delicious, as well as coconut vermicelli noodles. The pho had just the right flavour with a generous helping of greens and tofu in the broth. The spring rolls were great, and I believe filled with tofu skin as well as greens and vermicelli noodles. You can also order the spring rolls individually ($1.95) which I think is a plus. The dipping sauce was great! We also had the vegetarian wontons as an appetizer. Everything was fresh and came out very quickly!

It's definitely one of the better tasting pho broths that I've had in pho around Pittsburgh. Noodles were alright, what one would expect in a dish like this. Not too floury, but also not too thin (to the point of falling apart). The pho also came along with a dish of bean sprouts and basil. I mostly used the bean sprouts, which came fresh.\\nIn general, I found it to be relatively satisfying. I'll have to come back sometime to try some of their other offerings, but so far a good first impression certainly helps.\"],\n",

       "  u'Tram\\'s is one of the best options for quick and healthy vegetarian/vegan food in the Lawrenceville area.  I am obsessed with the \"tofu and veggies\" (same item on the appetizer list and the noodle entree section)-- it is a cold dish with a piquant, vinegar-based sauce and lots of fresh herb leaves with julienned veggies and a well-cooked tofu with an excellent texture.  I crave this stuff.  It tastes so good that it\\'s shocking how healthful it actually must be.  Other favorites are the spring rolls, the vermicelli with tofu and vegetables (hot dish with a different sauce and vegetables), and the pho soup.  The complaints in other reviews are spot-on: it is cash only and BYOB, a bit cranky and rushed service-wise at times, and not the most restful decor and interior (noise from tv and staff\\'s children and dated plastic tablecloths/decor).  Don\\'t let that stop you from going.'],\n",

It really is HER KITCHEN, not a restaurant... There is only one table that seats 8-10 people.  But her cooking is amazing.  Lots of home-style italian favorites come out in a fabulous 6 course meal.  I could have eaten just the antipasti alone as a full meal; the standout was a baked pumpkin full of gruyere, herbs and croutons... delicious.  For dinner, we had butternut squash soup with gorganzola and pecans, homemade pasta with a pistachio cream sauce, veal chops and an italian vegetable medely that was perfect with everything else.  Tiramisu for desert.  Everything that came out was delicious and perfectly prepared - plus Maria was standing right there in the kitchen to answer any questions we had about the food or cooking in general.  Wine was BYOB, and I think we went through ~10 bottles.  No corkage fees...\\n\\nThis is an amazing dinner for those who have patience.

       "  u\"I can't say enough about Merante's and Maria. The back of the shop has wonderful baked goods. Pies, breads and of course the best biscotti around! Though, the true treasure exists in the upstairs apartment where Maria has cooking classes and serves a 6 course meal to parties of  8-10 most nights of the week. I heard about the private parties while at a food tour of Bloomfield. I knew I needed to get a reservation but, I had no idea how difficult that task would be. We scheduled a dinner in October for the first available Friday or Saturday which was 6 months later! That's right folks, 6 months in advance! \\n\\nThe menu changes seasonally and is posted on the website. We ordered earlier in the week so that Maria had time to purchase the necessary items and prepare our meal. The menu would typically be the same for all 8 in the party but, Maria graciously offered to allow us to split the entrees into a meat and a non meat option to allow those who don't eat meat on Fridays during lent to have another option. When we arrived, we all enjoyed the appetizers in a sitting room at the front of the apartment. The appetizers themselves were a meal- meatballs, bread, shrimp, spinach pie, stuffed tomatoes and cheese with roasted peppers- all of which were incredible. Bring along your wine as Merante's is BYOB. \\nThe next course was soup which we were served in the formal dinning room which opened to the small kitchen where Maria cooks your meal. At first it was a little awkward sitting so close to the kitchen and Maria. Imagine having dinner at your grandmother's home with 7  of your closest friends. But, Maria did a great job of giving us our privacy. We hardly even noticed that she was there. After the soup came the pasta (homemade gnocchi anyone?), then the entrees and vegetables, then the salad and last, the dessert. This was a meal fit for a king! The portions were huge! Luckily, Maria boxed up the leftovers making for an easy lunch the next day. If your lucky, you may even get to take home a little extra something such as extra sauce or a homemade truffle. Absolutely everything about this dinner was perfection. Everything (from the food to the service and hospitality) was done with the utmost care and concern to ensure a wonderful experience. I would literally come here every month if it were possible. Unfortunately, Maria is booked through the end of 2014! Not one day available in the next 8 months! My only complaint, Maria is in serious need of a clone.\"],\n",

       "  u\"This review is specifically for the dinner that I enjoyed in the apartment above Merante's Gift Shop.\\n\\nI have stopped by here twice now for dinner, both times with a group of 8 people.  The first time that we ate here my wife and I were both unsure of where to go.  We hesistantly headed up the stairs next to the shop into the apartment above which thankfully ended up being the correct place!  The apartment consists of a couple of rooms off to the right where you can mingle and eat your appetizers and then the kitchen a bit farther down where we have always had the rest of our meal.\\n\\nOn both of our visits we have started off the evening with 6 different appetizers.  This last time around we had meatballs, a tuscan loaf of bread covered in spices, a cucumber salad, stuffed mushrooms, roasted vegetables and a stuffed tomato.  My favorite of the bunch both times was the tuscan loaf covered in spices.  After you finish up the appetizers you are invited into the kitchen where the rest of the meal is served family style.  First up at the table was our soup which was a minostrone genovese.  Maria, the main cook, suggested that we add some red pepper flakes and some parmesan to it which gave it some extra flavor and the little bit of kick which I loved.  Whenever we were finished with our soups, ricotta gnocchi was served to our table with a red sauce made with pork and beef simmered in red wine and tomatoes.  What is nice about this place is that Maria is very accomodating to food allergies.  Since I am not able to have red wine, they made a special bowl of the gnocchi for me with a san marzano sauce.  It was really good and I loved how light and fluffy the gnocchi ended up being.  Once that course was finished we were presented with a crown roast of pork on one platter and winter vegetables on another.  The crown roast of pork was quite impressive and the 8 of us had a hard time finishing even half of.  The vegetables were also good here and I was sad that I had filled up as much as I did as I was not able to eat as many as I would have liked.  There was also some green beans with tomatoes and olives floating around which is pretty much the only item of the night that I didn't really care for.  While I normally love green beans, they tasted of the olives that they were cooked with and so it wasn't for me.  Of course with all of the other food on the table I didn't even really care and I know its something that I normally would not have ordered at a restaurant.  The salad was served next after the main course.  It consisted of apples, pecans and cranberries over Romaine and was topped with their balsamic glaze dressing.  It was really good and I especially loved the large granules of sea salt (Maldon perhaps?) that were on it which helped to make it taste extra good.  Last but not least was our dessert which was Chocolate LOOOOOOVE Cake.  It consisted of chocolate custard, chocolate cake and chocolate Mousse.  Since chocalate is the other food besides red wine which I am not able to enjoy, Maria was nice enough to make me a cinnamon cannoli for dessert.  While everyone was enjoying their chocolate cake, my dessert was brought to the table and was greeted with an audible sigh from some other members of our party that they were not getting the cannoli also.  As we were finishing our desserts Maria produced a decaf espresso for anyone that wanted it.  It had a nice orange flavor to it and was very good.  When all was said and done, all of the substantial amount of food that our group did not eat was packed up by Maria and set aside for us to take home.  Everyone ended up leaving with a fair amount of it.\\n\\nThe bottom line for me is that we will be back here again in the future.  As a matter of a fact we already have our reservation made with the same group for July.  Beyond that my wife and I are trying to get some family together for another time.  If you are looking at trying to eat here I recommend that you book early because as of early Februrary all of the weekend days through November were already booked.  The only other thing to note about this place is that it is BYOB.\"],\n",

I was greeted by a women who was not the least bit friendly and told me that what I was smelling could be anything. She kept asking people, can I help you? Soon I realized that maybe the back of the store was off limites? There is a cookie counter with window back there, so it looks like it is just part of the store, but by her unfriendly insistance about what I wanted, I got the sense that I was not to be there. I asked to buy one of the peanut butter cookies that that had been making... thinking that I could eat it while browsing in the store... and she quickly responded,  \"We only sell them by the half or full dozen.\" By this time, I didn\\'t feel very welcome or even that she was interested in selling me anything.

It will always be home-cooked, open and ready to accept you regardless of the time of day or the day of the week. All that is truly required is that you find one item on the menu that you really enjoy. For me, that one item is the Grilled Chicken Breast Dinner. I almost always get this item with the veggie of the day, sliced tomatoes or sliced cucumbers. It always tastes good and it never breaks the bank. Sometimes I might get breakfast, but usually it is the grilled chicken breast.\\n\\nEveryone should try Ritter's at least once.  They only accept cash, but they do have an ATM present at the entry. Every now and then, I do allow myself to order a slice of the freshly made banana cream pie. Wow...it is tasty.\"],\n",

Fifty cents a play and it only takes quarters. It's easy to have your own little dance party in the booth.\\n\\nAs many have said before, cash only. So if you don't already have your cash or stopped at an ATM, no need to worry there is an ATM right as you walk in.  Not sure if its like this all the time, but it's a seat yourself type of establishment.  When we were there the place wasn't too busy and easy to run for the one server manning the floor.  I love the fact that the server wears scrubs being in close proximity to Shadyside hospital (of course don't expect surgery here).\\n\\nThe place is set up like a classic diner inside with the addition of some late model wood paneling. It's hideous, and I love it. From the booths to the counter seats (where I assume you have to be a regular to sit there). Even the desert case at the register, sadly only filled with minimal treats to take with you.  The bathrooms are typical and scary. I walked into a swimming pool waiting to happen because someone forgot to turn off the water. \\n\\nThe food, hmm the food. What an interesting array of food to have for this place. From grape leaves to meatloaf. Speaking of meatloaf, that's what I had. Two decent size slices of meatloaf, a scoop of diner mashed potatoes, and the gravy on the side. I also opted for the side salad, which was simple with iceberg lettuce, onion, tomato and green pepper. And the fresh (is it really fresh?) bread that they give you is amazing.\\n\\nIf this place is this good at night, I can only imagine what it's like during the day.\"],\n",

I was prepared to be disappointed by the food again but I instead I had to kick myself on that last review. \\n\\nIt was still diner food, but as far as diner food goes, it was impressive. I didn't even know diners served this vast variety of food.  I am a huge fan of breakfast food, because besides it being the most important meal of the day, I love the doughy goodness and comfort of pancakes and waffles. This time I was dissuaded from ordering my usual and instead opted for some proper dinner food. \\n\\nThe spanakopita was a bit soggy but otherwise the meal was above satisfactory. I had my first experience of fried zucchini and now I know what the fuss is all about! They're a delicious alternative to the classic potato fries and I delight to try them again.  While many people are unfavorably disposed to fish,  I love it. I think it's an acquired taste, but their fish was perfectly crispy and the tartar sauce wasn't half bad either! I would definitely go to this place again for a late night meal. \\n\\nAlso their mini jukeboxes are incredibly cute so if you're feeling extremely nostalgic of the '40's then I'd go here.\"],\n",

       "  u\"Great food, quick service, nostalgia: what more could you ask for? \\n\\nMy dad brought me to Ritter's many times when I was a kid, before we moved out of the city. Now that I'm commuting to Pitt, I'm back. Before even talking about the food, I'd like to say how nice the staff is. They're always in a good mood, and they know their stuff. In the three years that I've been going there I don't think that they've ever let my coffee cup go empty. \\n\\nBreakfast is excellent, no matter what time of day you have it. I especially love their homefries, which are nice and crispy but not overdone. This may seem like a minor thing, but you'd be surprised how many restaurants can mess up a fried potato. If you're coming in for lunch I would strongly suggest one of their salads; the lettuce is fresh and crisp and so are the toppings. If you get a steak salad, the steak comes right off of the grill and onto your plate, along with the fries. The soups are also delicious, although the Greek Lemon Soup is a bit sweet. I love their Navy Bean and Beef Barley soups, can't get enough of them. For lunch or dinner they have good comfort food: meatloaf with mushroom gravy, pork chops and kraut, stuffed cabbage, etc. Some days they make a homemade Greek pastitsio (did I spell that right?), which I think is even better than what is served at the Greek Food Festival in Oakland. \\n\\nOne last thing that I'd like to say is that they know how to make eggs over-easy. I like my fried eggs very runny or dippy or however you say it, and Ritter's makes them just so. A lot of breakfast places that I've been to tend to give you over-medium when you ask for over-easy. Just another indication that the cooks know their stuff.\"],\n",

       "  u\"Your standard, no-frills diner. Open all day err day, coming here is practically a requirement after a night on Walnut Street. Even during the daytime hours, I prefer Ritter's to Pamela's. Ritter's is spacious - no matter what time I show up, I've never had to wait. It's not anything to marvel at, but it's diner food, and you're getting exactly what you think. \\n\\nTheir menu is typical diner food, but more expansive than most - I was a little surprised to see seafood options. Ultimately, I always come back to the corned beef hash. Exactly like canned corned beef hash in every other diner, but that's exactly what I'm looking for. I also occasionally order the wings because Ritter's makes them the way I prefer - freshly fried, naked, with your choice of dipping sauce on the side. I've occasionally tried to branch out but find other dishes lacking. The meatloaf was dry, lacking in flavor, but still a very heavy dish; the burger was even dryer and was served deconstructed - in a bad way. However, friends have had the differing variants of the pancakes and enjoyed them. \\n\\nOverall, the cheap prices (yet cash only!), 24 hour convenience, and rectifying my late night munchies get Ritter's a thumbs-up in my book.\"],\n",

       "  u\"I remember my first experience at a diner: Art Deco-inspired architecture, narrow and long floorplan, jukeboxes, neon signs, quick service, and extremely tasty pancakes with chocolate syrup! Granted I was only 7 or 8 years old then, but I can recall everything (how can I forget the taste of those pancakes?!). Since then, I've been to quite a few diners, including diner-restaurants (i.e. faux diners). I would go particularly on the morning after a night of partying and/or drinking, when I'm feeling too lazy or hung over to cook something decent without burning myself and my kitchen. On these mornings, I would typically order pancakes or omelettes with a side (usually hash browns) and coffee. Honestly, I've never eaten anything other than these breakfast staples at a diner.\\n\\nMy friends and I arranged to have a late brunch one day at Ritters Diner. Now, I didn't have much to eat the night before, so I couldn't wait until we met to have something to eat. So, I came to the diner having already eaten a light breakfast. A quick observation of the diner made me realize that this isn't a traditional diner; instead, it seemed more like a diner-restaurant. Oh well, there was still the service and the food to worry about. We sat down at a booth in the large room in the back of the restaurant. The waitress greeted us and took our drink orders immediately: two cups of coffee and two glasses of water. Several minutes later, we got our coffee and water, but weren't ready to order just yet. We spent several more minutes deciding, and when we were ready, we placed our menus in a neat stack in the center of the table to show that we were ready to order. We waited...and waited...and waited some more. Minutes turned into half an hour and longer. By that point, my friends were getting quite hangry. I was sitting there feeling sorry for them and very concerned with the poor service. This whole time, I was monitoring discreetly the other diners who had our waitress and arrived after we did. A few of them actually have gotten their food, have paid, and have left. After what seemed like an eternity, our waitress suddenly materializes and takes our order.\\n\\nWe get our food: chocolate chip pancakes; club sandwich; spinach omelette with cheese and buttered toast; and something else (sorry, I must've had too much coffee). My omelette was decent; I would have preferred if they hadn't used too much cheese, especially what I think was American cheese (it could've been cheddar, but the taste didn't seem right). The toast was good, but I was too full to keep eating. I did try a bite of the chocolate chip pancakes, and it was so rich and delicious! My other two starving friends pretty much inhaled their food in minutes.\\n\\nBased on this one experience, I would come only for the pancakes. Service was really bad even though the place was half empty. I might experiment with this diner once or twice more to get a better feel for it.\\n\\nSo to summarize: not a real diner, service was bad, food was decent, and come for the pancakes.\"],\n",

While waiting in the line, an employee and the owner asked us (in the rudest and most condescending manner possible) to shut the front door because it was cold--despite the fact that we were not the ones holding it open. When our waitress took our order, I asked her if the hot turkey sandwich or the turkey, bacon, and Swiss sandwich was better. She looked at me as if I had just asked her if they sold toilet brushes there before shrugging and telling me that \"they are both pretty popular.\" We ordered wings and pierogies for appetizers, for which we waited 45 minutes. When my boyfriend asked our waitress if the food would be coming soon, she again acted extremely annoyed, as if our presence was a nuisance. She told us she did not know when the food would be up because \"Sundays are really busy.\" When the pierogies came we were disappointed to realize that only three came in an order. The wings were dry. I had decided on the hot turkey sandwich, which was a little dry but tasted okay overall.

Yeah, that place is that old and that outdated.\\n\\nMy Order : Eggs/Sausage/Potatoes/Toast, Fried Chicken and French Fries and finally, Chili Cheese Fries.\\n\\nThe good:\\n- They have parking, though their lot is a bit odd. No parking = no visit from me.\\n- The eggs were pretty good. Can't say anything bad about them and they were some of the better eggs I had. \\n- The potatoes/home fries were also pretty good. \\n- I really like the consistency of their french fries. Their fries are long and taste good.\\n- The breakfast prices are reasonable.\\n- They do have a wide variety of options on their menu. They have seafood, burgers, hot dogs, chicken, steak, breakfast food, ice cream and other stuff.\\n\\nThe bad:\\n- It's 2015 and they have no website or menu. Think about that. I have no idea how they could ever find customers not from the local area. They could put up a website for free and a menu as well. It would take less than 1 day of their time. There's restaurants from third world countries that have menu's online.\\n- They want $1.75 for cheese on their eggs. I can almost buy a full pack of cheese for that price\\n- The fried chicken is so so, but they want $7.70ish for one chicken wing sized leg, a mostly small breast and an even smaller leg. Not worth it at all, since you can get a better deal at Popeye's or KFC, who I both find expensive. Their chicken is better too.\\n\\nMy friend got an omelet of some sort and seemed to really like it.\\n\\nWould I return there? I could see myself returning for a quick breakfast once in a while, but I don't see myself going there for dinner.\\n\\nRecommendation: I can't say I recommend you going out of your way for this place.

Anyways, we made our way past the pack of chain smoking waitresses on the front steps and were seated. Every surface in this place is covered in a thin layer of oily grime. It\\'s clear that cleanliness is not a priority here. Your hand will stick to the table if you touch it.

The little old white-haired curmudgeon who I guess runs the place shuffles over to the counter, rips the bill out of my hand and says \"Give me $28.38\". I politely ask if we could pay separately (there were four of us). He grunts something inaudible with a sourpuss look on his face and I ask him to repeat himself. He then raises his voice and rudely says \"Give me $28.38. I don\\'t have time for this, I\\'m very busy\". It was 1:00 am, there were maybe 10 people in the entire place, and all he was doing was sipping coffee at the counter.

While I listened to the waitress arguing with another old timer over the price of a roll (who manages this and let's this stuff go on?), I decided to check the silverware. Yep...leftover food particles. I have a healthy immune system I think....well then my sprite came in a clear glass. The white milk like stain on the inside of the drink was slowly flaking off into my ice....last straw...I told the waitress and walked out. FILTHY MCNASTY!  My morning review is below:\\n\\n\\nWalked over from UPMC to have breakfast. Typical diner look and menu. I really don't get the hype as the food was average at best. The server was nice and attentive thus the third star. One thing that bothered me was one old man who just got up got behind the counter and helped himself to drinks. Clearly a customer and not an owner. I may try something else but really underwhelming concerning the hype.\"],\n",

       "  u'I was visiting a church in the area and decided to try this diner. It had mixed reviews so my curiosity got the best of me. \\nThe menu is lengthy. I am a huge breakfast food fan so I decided to order breakfast. I usually go the eggs and bacon route, but flipped the script when I saw the Coco Loco pancakes. They are pancakes with chocolate chips and coconut. I also ordered a side of bacon. My son got bacon & eggs that came with toast and home fries. \\nWhen my pancakes came they looked like your typical pancakes with a light sprinkling of coconut and chocolate chips. There was also a drizzle of chocolate syrup. I was a tad disappointed. I ate the top pancake and it was incredibly delicious. I thought \" it\\'s too bad this is not in each pancake. Still hungry I started eating the two remaining pancakes. Oh. My. Word. There wasn\\'t any coconut in them but they were packed with chocolate chips. I\\'m talking packed!  They were some of the best pancakes I\\'ve ever had. The side of bacon was a little salty which was needed to break up all of the sweetness of the pancakes. My son eats \"dippy\" eggs ( runny sunny side up). I\\'m not a fan but he enjoyed them. Living in the Burgh we are used to getting Italian bread as toast but this was true blue white sandwich bread. He cleaned his plate so that should tell you that he liked it a lot. \\nThe diner is exactly that-a true diner. It has never been updated. The menu has probably been the same for more than 25 years. But if your parking lots (they have 2) are filled that means you are doing something right. The cars were everything from old beaters to Porches. That says a lot as well. \\nWe will definitely be back to try other menu items!!'],\n",

       "  u\"Once again, the best friend and I were out and about on errands - in this case, her appointment with the dentist - and what better food choice to explore before 'open wide' than good old family Italian? Can we get extra onions with that?\\n\\nWe decided to give the lunch buffet a try, and arrived around 11:30 am. Sign on the door said hours were 11 am to whatever, but we got there to find the doors still locked.  I walked around the corner to see a studly guy standing outside the back door smoking, and asked if they were open. He looked at me surprised, and said he'd be right there. He came and unlocked the front doors, and in we went, past the muscle man with the cool brown eyes.\\n\\nWe were the first to arrive, and as I looked around the room(s) and I have to say it was kind of charming in that 1970's Soprano's kind of way. Like a mom and pop Italian place you'd expect to find somewhere in Jersey.  This is kind of living proof that Pittsburgh is indeed stuck in 1979, but in this case, in a GOOD way. There's even a baby grand piano just inside the front doors.\\n\\nWe did not order from the menu, as I said, we went to try the lunch buffet and I have to say, we were impressed.\\n\\nIt is not a large buffet, quite small in fact, but ample for only $7.95.  It basically contains a chafing dish of appetizers (this day had Clams Casino, some kind of fried mashed potato balls and fried zucchini), another with a pasta dish (tomato vodka today with fresh basil - VERY delicious), two meats (something like a beef brisket in one and the other a chicken cacciatore - the beef was excellent, as was the chicken), a small selection of salads (pasta, tossed, slaw and a bowl of beets), a tray of bread and rolls, and two different cakes for dessert.\\n\\nNow, even though we were the first to arrive, meaning early and the food was fresh, the chef and his trainee kept attending to the hot foods, showing sincere concern that it all stay fresh...and it did the entire time we were there. \\n\\nThe waitress was a very pretty 'woman' as opposed to the usual college student, and was extremely nice and helpful. The muscle man was apparently the bartender - ok - you can stand there and look pretty as long as you like.\\n\\nThey carried Pepsi products, so we ordered fresh brewed tea instead, and it was fine.\\n\\nTotal bill for two for a very satisfying lunch buffet was $20 and some change, very pleasant service AND eye candy, and a quaint trip down 'Scenes From An Italian Restaurant' meets 'Soprano's' memory lane.  \\n\\nI can't speak for dinner (yet) but if the food is as good, skip the pretentious Bistroids, and barking manager of Del's, and the potential gunfire from Pleasure Bar...and give them a shot. And DEFINITELY drop by for a super inexpensive and pleasant lunch if you happen to find yourself in the Bloomfield neighborhood.\"],\n",

       "  u\"Well, as stated in the previous review of their lunch buffet, we finally went for dinner, and were horribly disappointed to discover a night-and-day comparison between the lunch and dinner. I had gnocchi, she had Veal Imperial, and we ordered 'traditional style' which meant for an addition $4 it came with marinated mushrooms, Clams Casino, soup and salad. My friend left 1/3 of her veal dish on her plate and didn't want to take it home. I took a bite, and my tongue experienced absolutely no flavor, to the extent that I had to take a sip of my iced tea to see if I was getting a cold and losing my sense of taste. I could taste the tea. I could taste absolutely NOTHING from her veal.  With the gnocchi, I ordered the sausage, which was again $3 extra, and when it arrived it was a flat sausage patty cut in half, that tasted like a dry sausage McMuffin patty. The salad was basic iceberg lettuce and a few other veggies. The wedding soup had two tiny meatballs and about 1/3 cup of celery. The meal in general was a total disaster, but we ordered dessert anyway, and the tiramisu was still partially frozen. Then the bill came to over $82.  \\n\\nWe could not believe that we'd enjoyed the lunch buffet so completely, which was only $7.95, and that this dinner, as overpriced as it already was, was so completely void of flavor and character. \\n\\nIt's baffling to comprehend that an Italian restaurant that's been around as long as they have would still survive with these prices and total lack of quality for dinner. We had gone in with such high hopes.  But honestly, for dinner, it was such a huge let-down, we'll never go back. We'll go to the lunch buffet, but never to dinner.

She fawned over our daughter and made us feel comfortable. \\n\\nAdditionally, the owner and chef both came to our table to talk to us. My husband and I felt like we were eating at a friend's house, and that warmth is a hell of a lot sexier than any atmosphere we've gotten in a swanky Shadyside lounge. \\n\\nWe ordered simple pasta dishes: linguine and meat sauce, and spaghetti and meatballs.

       "  u'Tessaro\\'s is one of those quaint timeless neighborhood pubs/restaurants that so many soulless national chains spend millions of dollars trying to recreate.  It\\'s one of my favorite weekday after-work places to visit and I come here often.\\n\\nThe restaurant has a real hardwood grill that is is located in full view of the main dining room and baths the neighborhood with the smokey sweet smell of grilled meats that makes you salivate and your stomach ache for food.  It\\'s one of those things that makes you feel that this place is going to be great - you cannot wait to get inside and order.\\n\\nThe interior always has a great vibe.  High tin-covered ceilings, old-school wood bar, exposed red brick, and denim tablecloths cover tables that are closely-spaced and nearly always full with patrons happily eating and drinking.  Arrive at a peak time, any weekday or weekend evening, and you\\'ll likely be getting a drink at that nice bar while you wait for a table.  That\\'s OK - the bar is fully stocked, with local Penn Pilsner on tap (along with other good beers), and service is attentive and efficient.  Don\\'t forget to take a look at the chalkboard on the wall to see today\\'s specials.\\n\\nWhat to order:  You must try a burger here - I virtually guarantee that it will be one of the best you\\'ve ever had.  Tessaro\\'s grinds their beef for their burgers fresh daily, and they rely on their own recipe for their ground beef that mixes different cuts of beef in a predetermined proportion to achieve a balance of taste and the right amount of succulent fat - both for taste and for the right amount of drippings onto that hardwood fire which flares and sears the outside of the burger with tasty good stuff.  The burger is nicely-sized, with a great selection of cheeses and toppings, and grilled to your desired level of doneness.  This is the only restaurant where I frequently order a burger without any trimmings - just so I can taste the beef in all of its smokey goodness.\\n\\nA wish:  I wish they made better side dishes to accompany their burgers.  They offer some good side dishes: potato salad, steamed fresh vegetables; and some side dishes that could be better, especially the home fries, which tend to be soggy, greasy, and/or burnt.  They don\\'t offer french fries.  I think offering a proper french fry - made with freshly-cut potatoes, first par-fried at a lower temperature and then flash-fried at a very high temperature to order would go a very long way toward perfection.\\n\\nTheir soups are OK, and, strangely, a good portion of their menu is listed as \"Mexican\" fare.  They don\\'t need it, and would be better off limiting that fantastic hardwood grill to burgers, steaks, and fish specials.\\n\\nIf you haven\\'t visited yet, you will not be disappointed.  I highly recommend checking it out.'],\n",

It came on a delicious and soft roll and was cooked perfectly.  They don't have french fries, but I did get a side of homefries which was kinda strange to be eating with a burger.  Still, they were pretty good.  Overall the burger was really really satisfying.\\n\\nOther food I saw or tried wasn't really as impressive.

       "  u'Tessaro\\'s was both a passing point and my final destination on my hamburger road trip across America.  I\\'ve had famous burgers such as the ones at Mr. Bartley\\'s up in MA or the french bread burgers down at Rotier\\'s in Nashville as well as regional burgers like the green chili cheeseburgers of the southwest.\\n\\nAfter it all, I still see Tessaro\\'s as one of the best burgers I\\'ve had ever (my other top burger joints are scattered throughout the midwest where the beef is as fresh as fresh gets).  I started out with medium rare burgers when I first started going there, but eventually I toned down the knob to rare.  My cheese choice is always a slice of American.\\n\\nI typically like my burgers griddled with only burger bun and cheese, but since Tessaro\\'s serves up \"Pub Burgers\", I find it okay to eat with rabbit food (lettuce, tomato, onion).  Ketchup on a burger is blasphemy.  There is never a reason to add ketchup on a burger unless the burger is of poor quality.  Ketchup on a good burger is like heading to a prime steakhouse and asking for A1.  Save it for when you overcook your burgers at home or when you\\'re at McDonald\\'s.  Mustard is okay in reasonable quantities since its texture and taste complements the burger as opposed to covering it up.\\n\\nMy first thought was wow. These buns are huge. The top bun was awkwardly round and I had squish it a little to get a first bite that consisted of both burger and bun. It worked out in the end, as the buns were able to sop up all the excess beef juice without getting excessively soggy and difficult to hold. The patty itself was perfectly cooked. A full half pound of loosely packed coarse ground beef. I\\'m not sure what blend they use (definitely more than just chuck), but I want to guess around 75-80% lean, which is perfect in my book. The beef itself had an amazing texture and wasn\\'t heavily seasoned. The beef itself tasted remarkably fresh and just the right amount of \"beefy\". I usually order cheeseburgers over hamburgers as the slice of cheese makes the burger more forgiving to being overcooked and dry; however, at Tessaro\\'s, this was not the case. The slice of American cheese was perfectly melted and added the textural difference between the soft buns, the crisp lettuce, and the beefy patty. The lettuce and onions added additional contrast with their crunchy attributes, and the acidity from the two tomato slices balanced out the cheese. The soggy pickles were overshadowed by the red onion slices which offered not only a crunch but also a spicy kick, and I did not notice them at all.\\n\\nMy side choice is always home fries.  They come slightly charred and taste of delicious butter.  I had half my portion \"naked\" and paired the half with the traditional Heinz ketchup. Honestly they didn\\'t need the extra boost of flavor from the ketchup as they were amazing beforehand already. With the addition of the Heinz, the subtle tones of the char and butter were covered up, which was a pity.\\n\\nWhen you go to a steakhouse you order a steak.  When you go to a coffeehouse you order a coffee.  When you go to Tessaro\\'s you order a burger.'],\n",

This wasn\\'t bad, but I really love the classic combination of burgers and fries. Maybe it was an off day. I know they have their own butcher who works in house, and that is exciting. But the burger wasn\\'t memorable at all.\\n\\n\\nBottom Line: I\\'ve had better.'],\n",

Service was prompt and friendly. The space is a bit crowded but not oppressively so.\\n\\nOn to the main point - burger, burger, burger. A 1/2 lb burger topped with any variety of fixings on a nice soft bun. Expertly cooked to order (I usually prefer medium to medium-well).

I stabbed my fork in the same potato she had settled on and yelled NO! And just think, this is JUST the potato salad from here! \\n\\nThe burgers are the juiciest biggest most incredible burgers ever! I stick with the cheeseburger because I want to enjoy the burger without any fancy smancy stuff on it. I literally had the first bite of the burger and the juice squirted out the other side. Ok, I know that sounds dirty...but it was SO good!! I haven't strayed much from the burgers, but I did have the tuna melt once and it was good, but nothing compares to the burgers. I mean, that's what you go there for! Plus, my friend saw Russell Crowe there while he was filming a movie in the burgh, so you have to know it's good if his peeps recommended he go there!\"],\n",

Having said that, my last experience at Tessaro's was ruined before we were even seated.  While waiting with my girlfriend to be seated for 25 minutes, a party of 3 walks in and is immediately seated.  When I ask why a party of 3 would be seated before the many parties of 2 waiting I was told that the seating was laid out specifically to accommodate a specific number of people: absurd!  We proceed to wait another 15 minutes until a 2 top opened up.  \\n\\nI would gladly recommend this place on the food, but given how inefficient the seating system is I'd only go when you can be seated right away.\"],\n",

The meny is traditional and I've only had their burger. Yes, their burger is incredible. It's huge, cooked well, and on a good, sturdy bun. Like all good burgers, the meat steals the show but the veggies keep the burger's pace. I hate a burger that's all meat, Tessaro's is very balanced. I wish they had french fries as a side but, like I said, it's an old school joint and they serve old school sides.\\n\\nEither way, I can't complain, their homefried potatoes are good.\\n\\nThe service is impeccable and I haven't had anyone who wasn't over 40 and looked like they'ved worked there their whole life.

Tessaro\\'s in Bloomfield is almost the best in the Burgh, but I thought it didn\\'t quite live up to the hype.\\n\\nI went for all the fix-ins with the Gourmet Burger- a 1/2 pound patty with bacon, mushrooms, onions, and cheese. I had mine medium rare with mayo, and it was big and juicy, but something missed the mark. Maybe it was the flavor of the meat or the so-so bun. Don\\'t get me wrong- the burger was amazing, but not the best in my opinion. I had it with a side of potato salad, which was also good, but the portion size was dissappointing. Again- great food, but not the best. \\n\\nAlso, I was surprised by the wait- sure, they have the \"best burger in town,\" but I didn\\'t appreciate waiting over an hour while smashed up against other patrons in the doorway. Once we were sat, we were in a tight, cramped corner and the waitress was so-so on service. The decor has a great eclectic Pittsburgh feel, which was cool, but I didn\\'t get to enjoy it as I felt rushed by the waitress.\\n\\nOver all, the food was great and Tessaro\\'s is a Pittsburgh fixture.

I like good food that is somewhat healthy and sustainable.  \\n\\nAll that being said, I have searching a place that serves great burgers.  I hardly ever order an entree that focuses on meat and it is even more rare that I order a burger.  So I read lots of reviews about Tessaro\\'s.  I expected a dive with somewhat gruff service.  Uh, no, Tessaro\\'s is a tin ceiling, hardwood walled, hand painted mural delight.  And the service was tremendous.  Yes it was a Thursday and no the place was overflowing with hungry people but there was a steady flow of diners.  I must mention that many complained in their reviews about not being seated until all of party was there...uh, yeah! That makes sense to me.  No use taking up a table with a partial party who is \"faffing.\" (Google term if confused)\\n  \\nI had a medium rare burger with lettuce, tomato, pickles and relish and Dijon on the side with steamed broccoli and cauliflower.  My handsome dinner partner had a medium creamy bleu cheese burger and home fries.  The beef was good!!  This means a lot coming from me a non-meat eater.  The wood fire grill gave a super flavor and both burgers were cooked perfectly to temperature.  My veggies were freshly steamed and looked like veggies, not a mush of frozen overcooked goop.  Mr. Handsome devoured his burger and home fries. Evidence of more satisfaction.  Oh we split a small spinach salad to start.  Our waitress-who I should mention again was great-had the kitchen divide it on two plates.\\n\\nWill be recommending Tessaro\\'s to others and I have found my once-maybe twice-a-year burger joint!\\n\\nPS there are options for non-meat eaters:)'],\n",

Burger is cooked to perfection and so juicy that I have to cut the burger in half to tackle and not make such a mess.

It\\'s my go-to place for meeting friends for a meal when we want something tried and true with no froufrou. And I am never disappointed. \\n\\nI have heard grumblings for the past couple of years that Tessaro\\'s partially cooks their burgers throughout the day and then finishes cooking them \"to order\" so I asked the waitress if I could have a fresh patty, not pre-cooked. She didn\\'t seem bothered by my request. And honestly, I don\\'t know if I would be able to tell the difference. That being said, it still was the best tasting perfectly cooked burger I have had in a long, long time. With all the new specialty burger joints popping up across the country, I still dare any one of them to stand off side by side with Tessaro\\'s. Our usual picks are the Deli and the Bacon-Blue Cheeseburger, but you can pick any burger on the menu and be satisfied, and then some. I also love their home fries. Yummy! The marinated gourmet chicken sandwich is also a winner if you aren\\'t into red meat! \\n\\nOne of my other favorites at Tessaro\\'s which I have to admit I haven\\'t had in eons since we haven\\'t made it there for lunch recently is the tuna melt on rye. It has been on the menu forever. If you want one, you have to go for lunch as even though its on the lunch menu, they refuse to make it at dinner :( \\n\\nThe atmosphere here is strictly neighborhood bar/restaurant. Nothing fancy. I am sometimes put off by the way they offer seating (first-come, first-serve) and they will try to cram four people at a table that is meant for only three. If they are not scrambling for tables to seat people waiting, I\\'d ask for another less cramped table and wait; but on a crowded night, take the first thing available or you could be waiting a long, long time.'],\n",

I don\\'t think they want us there. Every interaction seems designed to make people feel awkward.\\n\\nThe burger itself  -- the actual cooked meat -- is indeed good, but they have no interest in all the other stuff that turns cooked meat into a hamburger experience.  The buns are poor quality; they absorb juices and toppings so they get sloppy and disgusting after a few bites. The burger just falls apart in your hands (or onto your lap). You have to finish it with a fork.  \\n\\nThey don\\'t serve French fries, and they seem affronted when you ask for some.  This is a bizarre, given that everything else about the place screams \"we have fries here!\" Why withhold fries from customers who surely have been asking for them every day for years? This hints at either a weird purist dogmatic sensibility, or deliberate sabotage.  Why not serve fries *and* homefries?  Are they afraid the fries will win, exposing the hollow sham that the homefries have been all along?\\n\\nI\\'ve come to believe that everyone at Tessaro\\'s is under a spell where they must cook and serve excellent hamburgers, but they hate cooking and serving hamburgers. Everything about the restaurant that is not an actual meat patty is cleverly designed to keep you away.

I went with a traditional American cheeseburger, while Christian, I mean, my husband, got the Gourmet burger. Both were cooked to our specifications (medium and rare, respectively), and were juicy and flavorful. No french fries here as sides, which is an interesting decision, and makes the experience more unique. Though we could have gotten something healthy, like steamed broccoli, we both went with the home fries. They were great: tender on the inside, crispy on the outside & flavorful. Because so many of the review focused on the burgers, we were surprised to see they have lots of other menu items, including fish & ribs. So, I plan to return and give some other menu items a try.

       "  u'I have to preface this review with two factors. One, I moved here from South Florida, where the best burgers in town came from your average diners.  They were the last bastion of American food in South Florida, so they served up REAL American food.  If you wanted a real burger, you went to a diner.  After returning to Pittsburgh, I found that every diner here has turned to serving up those frozen gray hockey puck patties and passing them off as burgers.\\n\\nSecond, (until the recent explosion of good burger joints in da burgh), I actually HAD been a fan of Tessaro\\'s, until their hostess/manager flat out offended the hell out of me and my party of three.  The result is that I have never, and WILL never return to Tessaro\\'s.\\n\\nMy best friend is a 62 y/o blind woman that I met doing theater in the 90\\'s in Pittsburgh.  She lives with her 91 year old mother, and her father (the driver) passed away several years ago.  I don\\'t drive, and rely on the bus system that Steve Bland is intentionally systematically destroying, so any outing that we make must be carefully planned.\\n\\nShe and I had met once at Tessaro\\'s.  It was her first time being there.  She took the Access van for the disabled, and I met her there after work via bus.  I walked in, she was seated, having a drink, waiting for me to join her. No problem.  We had a great meal, with an awesome burger.  I can\\'t say enough...they really do have mouthwatering burgers.\\n\\nMonths later, we decided to go again, and the plan was pretty much the same.  She took the Access van to the restaurant, and I was going to meet her by bus, and this time a new friend was going to join us, coming by bus from Oakland, and new to Pittsburgh.\\n\\nMy best friend called me at 4:30 (we were supposed to meet at 5) and said that her van had come early, and that she was already at the restaurant.  I told her I would get there as soon as I could.  I left work a few minutes before 5 pm, and arrived at the restaurant 5:15.  They were busy, but I was surprised to find my friend still standing in the doorway.  The blind woman had been standing there for 45 minutes.  \\n\\nI made my presence known, and the hostess/manager acknowledged, asked about our other friend. I explained that he was ten minutes away and coming by bus, new to the city, but WAS on his way.  She walked away from us.  We stood in the doorway fro another twenty minutes.\\n\\nFinally, the manager came back, and I caught her attention, and motioned my head toward my blind friend, and asked if we really had to keep waiting?  She\\'d been standing there in the doorway for over an hour.\\n\\nThe next statement sealed the deal on us never returning to Tessaro\\'s.  The manager slapped her hands on her hips, and started barking:\\n\\n\"LOOK!  We don\\'t have many rules around here!  In fact, we only have ONE, that you don\\'t get seated until your whole party is here!\"\\n\\nAnd THIS is what really sealed it:\\n\\nThe woman thrust her thumb in my BLIND friend\\'s direction, who had only been to Tessaro\\'s ONCE before in her life, with me, and said:\\n\\n\"And SHE oughta KNOW that!\"\\n\\nShe oughta know that?  Exactly HOW should she \\'know that\\'? The only other time she\\'d been there, she arrived before me, was seated, waited, and I joined her.\\n\\nAdditionally, the \\'rule\\' was posted...on a piece of 8 1/2 by 11 copy paper, taped to the wall at the end of the counter, behind several rows of water pitchers.  I couldn\\'t see the \\'rule\\'...a blind woman certainly wasn\\'t going to \\'see\\' it!\\n\\nFinally, after another ten minutes standing there, the manager \\'allowed\\' us to take a table and wait for our friend, who came five minutes later.  We ate our meal, paid our bill, and we left.\\n\\nAnd we will NOT return.\\n\\nYou can treat me badly, and if there\\'s something I really love about your business, I might come back.  But do NOT badmouth a blind woman, or anyone else for that matter, who is disabled, and in need of a slight amount of extra consideration.\\n\\nTessaro\\'s, you might make good burgers, and you\\'ll continue making a fortune off them.  And I\\'m sure you really don\\'t give a crap about how your manager treated this lady.  But we will NOT drop one dime more in your restaurant.  We\\'ll take our business to Burgatory.'],\n",

No.  Do I think that if you go to Tessaro's you'll have a fantastic burger and want to come back? Yes.\"],\n",

I literally went forty, 24 hour days without a single bite of meat.\\nSo whenever Lent ended, I had one thought on my mind, and that thought was a Gourmet Burger cooked at a delightful medium-rare from Tessaro's.\\n\\nNot having meat for forty days and then having a Tessaro's Gourmet Burger is like dying and going to a meaty paradise, where one can eat burgers all day and all night and never ever feel full.\\n\\nMy first bite into my burger led me to consuming the whole burger in no less than 2 or 3 minutes. I couldn't help myself, I kept eating and eating and eating as fast as I could, because my body was deprived of meaty protein for so long.\\n\\nThe Gourmet Burger came with lettuce, tomato, bacon, and my choice of provolone cheese. You also have the choice of yellow mustard, dijon mustard, or spicy brown mustard. I went with Yellow mustard, and mayonnaise, of course. I lathered the bun up perfectly with mayo and mustard and licked my fingers after my burger disappeared into my belly.Their potato salad and cole slaw are top-notch as well, and go amazingly with your burger.\\n\\nTessaro's burgers are AMAZING.

The smoked flavor is okay and the meat seems fresh, but where the hell is the flavor?  I can go as far as saying that I don\\'t believe that they even season the burger with salt and pepper.  If I closed my eyes, it is possible that I wouldn\\'t even know that it was a hamburger.  That is embarrassing.  Maybe if you\\'re used to eating 99 cent burgers, Sysco \"meat,\" or at chain restaurants, then you would find this to be \"amazing.\"  I\\'ve had some of the best burgers at many cities in the US and this is an embarrassment to Pittsburgh.  Go to BRGR if you want a tasty burger near Bloomfield.  On the other end of the spectrum were the sides. The sides were classics, but definitely above average, especially the home fries.  I would consider a 1 star rating if it weren\\'t for them.  Additionally, the place is overly crowded and had a long wait during the weekend. The decor is old school and seems satisfied in it\\'s current state.  Just like the food itself.  File this one under Legacy restaurant still living on it\\'s past accolades.'],\n",

       "  u\"Tessaro's is one of those Bloomfield institutions that certain generations of Pittsburghers always rave about. It's a place that's (apparently) been around forever and just has a cool, old school vibe to it. The decor is totally out of date, just like the uniforms the servers wear. Who thinks that the white button down shirt with the little black tie works in 2012? The owners of Tessaro's do, which is part of the charm.\\n\\nIf you're in the mood for a tasty burger when you're in Bloomfield, you can't go wrong with Tessaro's. For my most recent lunch visit, I decided to change it up a bit and went for the cheesesteak with a side of boiled red potatoes.\\n\\nI chuckled when my food arrived. The cheesesteak was ridiculously large, overflowing with meat. The red potatoes came with a cup of melted butter for dipping. If you don't think potatoes should come with a cup of melted butter, honestly, you should go somewhere else... somewhere else where you can enjoy hating flavor. Personally, I assaulted those potatoes and didn't look back.\\n\\nThe cheesesteak was average. With some salt added, it was slightly above average. My advice to the kitchen would be to add some more salt and pepper while cooking to make it tastier out of the gate.\\n\\nTessaro's provides a classic Pittsburgh experience. While the food may only be worth three out of five stars, I'm going to add on another star because I like the fact that the dining room is dark, the menu is filled with meat, and the staff is friendly and efficient. Bottom line,  Tessaro's is a solid choice if you're in the mood for meat and you want to minimize your chance of running into Bloomfield hipsters.\"],\n",

       "  u'Being a native of Pittsburgh I havea always heard tales of the best burger in Pittsburgh. Most of those tales had Tessaro\\'s as the destination in question. The first time and every subsequent time I have been there has held up to it\\'s legend. Don\\'t get me wrong, there may be better burgers in Pittsburgh, but I have yet to find them.\\n\\nTessaro\\'s has not only great burgers but also other foods that are delicious. Their menu is similar to what you would find in a steak house. They serve a lot of fish and steak aside from their burgers. After eating several different meals at Tessaro\\'s I can say with no doubt that my favorite thing there is the \"Bacon-Bleu\" burger with crumbled blue cheese (rather than creamy because they give you the opion). The bacon is amazing, the blue cheese melts to the bun within a coulple of minutes and the burger mean is so fresh that you can distinctly taste its freshness.\\n\\nThe ambiance of the place is really nice too. It is an older place which has kept that old Bloomfield feel still to this day. Everyone is extremely nice there. The owner is usually there at the door to greet you and is always willing to have a nice conversation with you in the time when she is not flying around trying to get people in their seats. \\n\\nThe only downfall with Tessaro\\'s and this is not their fault is that they are alway\\'s almost too busy. Because this place way a neighborhood bar at one point it doesn\\'t exactly have a lobby for you to wait in while you wait to be seated so that part of your dinner may be a bit uncofortable but all in all Tessaro\\'s will be a great experience, espescially for those who are a fan of the old fashion hamburger and beer.'],\n",

When I bit into it I tasted the smokiness of the grill and it was nice and juicy.  The toppings, though, were your standard lettuce, tomato, onion and pickle.  I would have loved to have this burger and the Burgatory toppings!  My 16 year old son finished his burger in no time flat, along with his hashbrowns, that he loved.  My father could not finish the burger, nor his coleslaw side.  I got a nice healthy side of steamed cauliflower and broccoli (like it mattered at this point), and was able to eat 3/4 of the burger and all my veggies!!\\n\\nMy only disappointment regarding the place was that they did not have dessert on the menu!!

       "  u\"Top contender for best burger in the 'Burgh.\\nI understand there are a lot of new boutique burger joints popping up in and around the Steel City, but remember before Burgatory, Wingharts, BRGR, etc there was a lone champion (save maybe Piper's) in the category of best burger and that belonged to Tessaro's.  As a former resident of the small friendly neighborhood of Friendship I visited Tessaro's many times and always wondered why I ever ate a burger outside my own house anywhere else.  They are fantastic, the meat  mixture is juicy, fresh, and has tons of good beef flavor.  The buns are warm and don't mess with the top billing.  The toppings compliment, but never overpower and the side of home fries is perfect in a sublime sort of way.  By far my favorite combo for a Tessaro's burger is one with grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, bacon, provolone, and mayo.  Cliches be damned this is a God send for a mouth.  Smack that sucker on a plate next to grilled home fries and pour me an imperial ale because it's go time. \\nIf you're new to the Burgh or new to the boutique burger scene do yourself a favor and get over to Bloomfield for the reigning champ, Tessaro's.\"],\n",

If it weren't for the blue cheese and bacon it would have been borderline inedible. There didn't seem to be any seasoning of the meat whatsoever. Bland would be an understatement. \\n\\nPoints for using fresh hand formed beef and consistently preparing it at the requested level of done-ness, but I don't know how the burger here even enter any debate regarding the best burger in the 'Burgh. I'd even say Lot 17 a few doors up has more flavorful burgers - saying nothing of places like Wingharts and Burgatory.\\n\\nService is always friendly and prompt - but the food is just...OK.

Baby on board, we walked in and waited to be greeted. The inside looked a bit old and run down. Tip: they do not have highchairs only booster seats which is impossible to get a squirmy baby to stay in. I would not suggest bringing a baby here. The tables are also very small and close together. We actually had to move the table out to get in and out of the corner booth. I decided on the basic cheeseburger and ordered the boiled red skin potatoes for the baby and a side of chips for me fully expecting homemade chips. Not the case. I got a handful of what seemed to be a ruffles knock off. The potatoes were very bland despite being served with warm butter on the side. Great for a picky baby. Bad for an adult who is looking for something tasty. Now to the burger. Huge, yes. Juicy, not even close. Despite ordering my burgers well done, I expect them to still be tender and juicy. This was not the case. My burger was as dry as a burnt piece of chicken. I ate half of it.

My date had the steak sandwich - he said it was delicious, but it's literally a steak on a bun, so it's hard to eat gracefully (maybe cut it up first?). We had home fries as our sides - I don't even really like home fries, but these were so yummy. Great food all around.\\n\\nOur food came out lightning fast. We didn't even think it was ours because it was literally five minutes after we ordered. And the service was amazing: so friendly, attentive and efficient.

I was very happy we came across this place.\\n\\nMy only complaint is that the dining tables in the back are very, very, very close together when they are all split into two-person tables.

Although I was disappointed that it didn't have more of a Cajun flavor to it.  There were some bites that snapped back with spiciness but for the most part I couldn't get much Cajun flavor.  I really enjoyed the charred bites of the burger...some folks may not really appreciate this and it wasn't overwhelming, if it was I probably wouldn't have liked it.  But overall it reminded me of a great burger cooked at a BBQ!   \\n\\nOne thing I didn't realize is all the fixins come on the side for you to put on it such as the pickles, mustard, ketchup, mayo...it worked out though since I wanted a little of each.\"],\n",

       "  u\"In our travels back to Pittsburgh to see family whenI grew up, we would always go to the Pleasure Bar for dinner at least one night we were there.  I am sure that's where my love of Italian food came from.  Even going back farther than that, my parents went there in the 50's all the time. They knew the (owner?) Johnny Collinger and spent many a night having a good time there.  I remember Johnny still worked behind the bar when I went there as a kid in the 70's and he remembered me when I went there with my parents and would always make me a Shirley Temple with extra cherries in it.  (Good customer service is important to kids too! LOL)  So know that you know my family history with the PB, I will tell you that we just recently went back there with my mother who is now 84 on a recent trip back to PA.  The food was still very good but maybe not quite as good as I remember.  Nothing was bad and to be fair, we only split the eggplant parm sandwich and the meatball sub between the table.  The meatball sub was good, but I think the meatballs could have had a bit more flavor.  We also ordered an order of potato balls which used to be the family favorite back in the day. They were still good, but MUCH less cheese in the middle than in the past.  Pleasure Bar - add some more cheese to the potato balls and they will be a standout favorite on your menu and you could be famous for them.  I'd also like to see them bring back a past favorite sandwich called the PB Special. It was nothing more than a hamburger with Italian sauce on it and mozzarella cheese but the combination was outstanding.  I remember ordering that many times as a kid.

It's a small neighborhood restaurant, the main dining room is small and it looks like you're in the banquet room of a Holiday Inn in 1985--but somehow the atmosphere is warm and friendly instead of dated and depressing.\\n\\nI have never called ahead for reservations and i have never had to wait for a table and I believe this is only bc I've got lucky every time I dine there.  The restaurant is ALWAYS busy and for good reason--the food is great!\\n\\nIs this authentic Italian food?  I have no idea.  I have an Oma and a Nain (german and welsh grandmothers, respectively).  Many dishes were served at our house growing up, nary a Pasta Pomodoro among them.  So while I do not know if this is authentic Italian food, I can tell you this food is the real deal.  It's really, really good.\\n\\nHeres what we had to eat last night:\\n\\nthe tomato and mozzarella salad.  Its a real pet peeve of mine when restaurants don't use very ripe roma tomatoes for these kinds of salads.  The tomato NEEDS to be very ripe and acidic and I was initially disappointed when I saw just regular beef steak tomato's in the dish.  These were no ordinary tomatoes!  They were marinated and amazing.  The mozzarella came out in large slices, and the waitress had recommended I dress it with balsamic vinegar which I did and it was excellent.\\n\\nMy friend ordered the Italian wedding soup and I found it a little bland but he loved the soup.  It was the perfect ratio of pasta to broth and it was not heavy on the salt which is a good sign--you know the kitchen staff TASTES the food before serving it!  (not your food, they taste the food as it is prepared.  you know what I mean)\\n\\nI ordered the Salmon del Mare as my main course, it was the special of the night and it was very good.  Broiled salmon topped with tomatoes, spinach, mozzarella cheese, and shrimp scampi. I asked for my shrimp on the side and I am very glad I did because I think they might have overwhelmed the salmon.  I thought they'd just put the shrimp on the side but instead they brought out a delicious shrimp scampi which was good and savory and garlicky...  mmmmmmmmmm i just had a moment.\\n\\nthe salmon was cooked just right--where it flakes but it's still moist and it was seasoned perfectly.  All of the ingredients were cooked so well I ended up deconstructing my dinner, and I had the salmon without any of the toppings, and then ate the spinach and tomatoes as if they were their own side.  A side of broccoli came with the entree and it was good but kind of unremarkable.  I mean, it's steamed broccoli.  It really didn't have a chance, considering it was brought out with the shrimp scampi.\\n\\nMy friend ordered the Pasta Christopher which had red peppers, chicken, and sausage mixed in with penne.  Full disclosure:  I'm freaking hate Italian sausage.  I'm german (American by way of Stuttgart, my German claims are legitimate!  Stimmt!) and I HATE spicy sausages.  I like sausage bland, covered in Senf (mustard), and made of ingredients you don't want to know about.\\n\\nMy friend found the Pasta Christopher delicious.  You're not going to leave the Pleasure Bar hungry, where he usually cleans his plate he asked for a to go box. \\n\\nWe were too full to have dessert.\\n\\nOur check came to $50, but $14 of that was beer, we each had a beer with dinner.\\n\\nthis restaurant is reasonable, and delicious.  If you bring a date here, they wont be impressed but they will be relaxed, have a great dinner, and you're not going to go broke.\\n\\nI highly recommend this place and I wish more people knew about it.  it is one of my favorite dining options in Bloomfield.\\n\\n\\nGlossary:\\n\\nOma:  German for grandmother\\nNain:  Welsh for grandmother\\nStimmt:  True.

I can not stand when waitresses/waiters see that we're younger (I'm 25, my friends are in their early 30s) and assume that they can drop all professionalism and talk to us like we're their friends. I sympathize with you being slammed but I don't want to hear you complaining nor do I want to hear about you getting wasted. We should have requested another waitress at that moment.\\n\\nTwo other tables who were seated 10-15 minutes after us got their food about 20 minutes before us. Two other waitresses were working the room and seemed fast and competent. We were the only table with Misty, who was working both the bar area and us. She never checked on us, took forever to get our food to us (which I'm assuming was sitting back in the kitchen for quite some time) and after we finished, we sat there for 20 minutes before we finally flagged down the hostess for our check. From the time we walked in to the time we walked out was a little over 2 hours. Would never consider going back.\\n\\nThe food was good.\"],\n",

Went back in August on a Friday and asked if we could sit outside at one of the tables in front,  bartender told us yeah but we would have to come inside to order things because it\\'s too busy. There were nine people in the bar section. It was nice out so we sat out there anyway. When our food was ready she knocked on the window and I had to go in to the bar and bring our food out to the table,  so it\\'s got a nice authentic touch of waiting your own table yet paying someone else to do it. Eventually realized that she was doing this because she was screwing a waitress out of the table and didn\\'t want to be seen. Classy. \\n\\nSame one was working the last time we went,  it was dead and she still couldn\\'t keep up. Everything she said to anyone was prefaced with \"give me a second I have to get this for these people first\"  and then she would look at her phone.

Friend had the chicken noodle soup, which I had a taste of, and it was delicious. Ranch dressing is my default condiment, and theirs is to die for. I was dipping bread in ranch after I had finished my salad. Speaking of, the Italian bread was fresh and delicious. Even the butter was great, despite coming from those little containers with the peel off top. Then we had the potato balls. Come on, you can't go wrong with balls of fried potatoes and cheese. They were really good. I had chicken parm and couldn't believe the size of it. After bread, salad, and potato balls, I was only able to eat about 1/4 of it. While it was good, I thought that my friend's carbonara was better. That's what I'll be getting next time. \\n\\nI ordered stuffed shells with a meatball to take to my mom.

His entree came with a wedding soup that was ok...but when the server brought it, the crackers fell to the worn, dirty carpet and she picked them up and put them on the table...gross. Our food took forever and when it got there I was highly disappointed. My Alfredo was tasteless. No salt or cheese, just a bland b\\xe9chamel.

The room was spacious with plenty of room for the four of us, no crusty stains and pretty clean smell. The bathroom was large with a single sink outside the room so one person could get ready while another showered (or puked their pants off in my case). The room could have used more mirrors to make it a little easier for me and the other girl to get ready without rubbing our butts together at the sink area, but I guess it was fine since I came down with some form of the plague over the weekend and no amount of primping was going to make me look like a respectable human anyway.  \\n\\nThe area the hotel is in seemed like a pretty central one for happening things and not too terribly far from ish, but their $20 nightly parking fee adds up. We're cheap so we opted to save our wallets from being raped of any Andrew Jackson's and parked at the meters surrounding the Marriott that run from 9-6pm each day. Just remember to set your alarm so you can have your quarters in the meter before the clock strikes 9am EST or you'll end up forking over $20 for a parking violation anyway, and the hipster meter maid man in this area was noticeably diligent. On Sundays the parking on Aiken right across from the Marriott and in front of that church is free, so we made it a point to snag a spot there so we could sleep in on our last day of Pittsburgh-ing. \\n\\nThey have an indoor pool, free coffee and computers usage in the lobby, free wi-fi throughout the whole hotel and conference rooms should you need that sort of thing for work as well. I had checked out a few hotels and rates before we went and for what we got and how almost-stain-free** the place was, this Marriott seemed world's better than the rest of the lot in our affordability price range \\n\\n** I (accidentally) left my signature Candice calling card, an orange-stained pillowcase.

Thankfully, my experience with Courtyard Pittsburgh Shadyside was the former.\\n\\nMy first reaction was, \"Wow, this room is huge.\" For $179 a night (part of a wedding room block, so unsure if this is discounted or not), we got a queen bed with a nice sized living area (couch, chair, coffee table, desk, etc.), and a balcony overlooking the city. The bed was situated in such a way that it has you looking straight out those sliding glass doors once you\\'re all tucked in - a really nice setup for a Courtyard. And above all, super clean. Even the wi-fi was fast and free, and therefore, fantastic. I was impressed.\\n\\nSo much so that I can more or less forgive the slew of minor annoyances/inconveniences/nitpicks/whathaveyou.

Just sayin\\'.\\n\\nAgain, these bullets should be taken with a grain of salt as the alternatives are more \"nice to haves\" rather than \"musts\" when checking off boxes for prospective hotels. At least, for me. As you can see from the rating, the good here more than outweighed the, well, not bad - let\\'s just say, slightly annoying.\\n\\nIf you have reason to stay near Shadyside versus downtown, this is your hotel.

       "  u\"This was an experience that was more than a 2, but I would find another hotel next time so I don't feel like I can give it a 3. \\n\\nFirst, mandatory valet parking is an annoyance. We are not downtown, and charging $17.88 to park is a lot at a $129 a night hotel. They do have a shuttle that you can use to go to areas within a few miles and its a good thing because there is not much to walk to in the general area.  \\n\\nThe closest things in waking distance are about a 1/2 mile away--but it is higher end chain-shops like the Apple Store and Athletica. I'd certainly walk a half mile for some unique, non chain shopping. But this was not what I had in mind. \\n\\nThe room was a good size, clean and mostly ok. With 2 queen beds there was not much leg room for other seating options. \\n\\nThe HVAC unit was very loud and it rattled. The toilet had a hard time and required 2 flushes per visit.  The shower was weak, but had a Speakman head. \\n\\nBut the bed was a big disappointment. The mattress was borderline uncomfortable. The linens were not very substantial, and the pillows were cheap and sponge like.  \\n\\nThe nightstand was unstable. When the drawer opened fully it toppled over. Poor design not helped by the heavy bibles--one regular and the Book of Mormon always present at any Marriott. \\n\\nAlso of note is that the hospital across the street must be, like all hospitals, a no smoking campus. With a Starbucks in the lobby of the hotel, there were always 4 to 10 smoking-slobs in and around a bench next to the hotel entrance giving the Courtyard a  flop-house like feel. \\n\\nI will say that the staff was great. Nice, helpful and ever present. \\n\\nI was not expecting the Ritz, but the actual accommodations were more like Holliday Inn/Hampton Inn and those properties are less money--again, we were at 129 with a big discount, so most customers are paying 150 per night and this was not in that price range in terms of quality. \\n\\nSince this location (and Pittsburgh's lack of an easy to use public transit system) requires a car, this was not a cheap hotel stay. We are normally Starwood people, and Marriott did little to sway my view that Starwood is a better brand, if for no other reason than the Sheraton mattress at every property--even Four Points which is equivalent to Courtyard. \\n\\nFor reasons that are unclear to me, Pittsburgh in general is expensive for hotels. All the Sheraton properties were more money, but given the reality on the ground I can see why.\"],\n",

Going through other reviews (here and on other sites), it seems some of the issues I had were not new or happening for the first time; this to me indicates they don't have the willingness or resources to maintain their rooms properly.\\n\\nIn order of appearance, here are the issues I had during my two night stay:\\n\\n- The minifridge had a former guest's leftovers still in it\\n\\n- The TV would sometimes not work-- rather, only the sound would work, but the screen would remain black. I'd have to turn it off and on again and that would do the trick usually\\n\\n- Their HVAC system was fairly loud IMO\\n\\n- Each side of the bed comes with a nightlight with an integrated power outlet. The power outlets were, in my opinion, shoddily installed; which meant that after plugging in my phone charger and leaving it on for the entire night, my phone did not fully charge. I discovered the only way to get it to charge was to manually hold the charger against the outlet, which I can do for a few minutes but after a while... it gets old. I didn't have problems plugging my charger in any other outlet, just the ones by the bed.\\n\\n- Yellow/brownish water! My room came with an awesome jacuzzi. Following instructions, I filled the jacuzzi with water, only to discover the water was yellow. First I thought the lighting in the room might be making it *look* yellow... but no, the water was actually quite yellowish/brown. I compared a glass of water taken from the jacuzzi to one taken from the sink area and the difference was noticeable. So if you do stay here, be on the lookout for the color of your water. But, not all jacuzzi hope is lost: I emptied the jacuzzi and re-filled it and the water looked more clear the second time. Hooray!\\n\\nSo those were the bad things. Now for the good:\\n\\n- Great customer service. The front desk was always very nice and polite and they had no problem with quickly getting me a blanket moments after I requested one (I felt cold in the room)\\n\\n- Convenient shuttle service. It only moves within a few miles of the hotel (so it won't take you or pick you up from the airport, unfortunately) but it was free, super useful to get around the city, and the drivers were friendly and knowledgeable about the area\\n\\nI should note that none of the problems I had were insurmountable (though yellowish water and strangers' leftovers are off-putting) and had it happened at a different price point, the customer service would have made up for it. But having paid $500 to stay there for 2 nights, I was pretty disappointed.\"],\n",

       "  u\"Three words: Cheap water ice!\\n\\nAfter a walk in Allegheny Cemetery yesterday afternoon (Memorial Day), CM and I were hot.  After checking to ensure that I had cash, I suggested that we stop by for a cool treat, and he assented.  Fortunately, when we pulled up and parked, I saw a sandwich board sign on the sidewalk stating that they were open.  Hooray!\\n\\nMy original plan was to order a cone of soft serve ice cream and have it dipped in chocolate topping and then in sprinkles.  However, the woman working told me they didn't have chocolate topping (?!?), so I had to change my plans.  CM was intrigued by the water ice (Italian ice), since he'd never had any, and decided to order one.  I decided to do the same, since I'd been looking for an alternative to Rita's (bleh!), but water ice is surprisingly difficult to come by in the Burgh.  I asked the woman what brand it is, and she informed me that it's Hershey's (I wasn't even aware that Hershey's made water ice, but apparently, they do, and it's sold under the Via Venetto label.)\\n\\nFor our water ices, CM ordered watermelon flavor, and I ordered tie dye, a combination of lemon, lime, and blue raspberry flavors.  The tie dye was a nice combination of tart and sweet flavors, but I wasn't a huge fan of the watermelon, since it tasted rather artificial to me.  The texture was velvety, as is appropriate for water ice, and it was cold enough that it didn't melt quickly.  Best of all, the price was right ($2.14 w/ tax for a small)--a dollar cheaper than Rita's, which is overpriced IMO, and with comparable or better quality.  (I'll have to see if I can get them to make a gelati!)\\n\\nOddly, despite the claim that they didn't have chocolate topping, I saw a kid with a cone that appeared to be dipped in just that.  I'll have to try ordering that again next time to see if this was a fluke.  Regardless, I'll definitely be stopping back here soon to get another fix of cheap, delicious water ice!\"],\n",

They have good solid pub food which is tasty and with big portions.  The food is always above par and I don\\'t ever think I\\'ve had something I wouldn\\'t order again.  I even got a grilled cheese and loved it!!  There is a bit of sticker shock, when you see a sandwich for around 8 bucks, but the sides and the taste make up the difference.

The waffle fries on the side were excellent; crisp but not overdone and well-seasoned.

I had a friend who lived here in the East End and on the street I reside on now. \\n\\nSeveral times we found ourselves at Silky\\'s Pub. I love the corner building, the way it looks out onto Liberty Ave. It looks so welcoming. Especially in the summer. Outdoor seating, always pretty well packed with people.\\n\\nI\\'ll come right out and say that the crowd that frequents Silky\\'s isn\\'t my usual crowd, but unlike some bars I\\'d never had an issue with someone wanting to start a fight with us because we look like a bunch of dirty malcontents. This place is just not our usual dive bar.\\n\\nThursday night my boyfriend texted me that he was there with a mutual friend. Living less than a city block from there I headed over. I needed a beer and some hockey/world series action to distract me after the Halloween parade. It was as busy as usual. A few seats remaining and I managed to snag one right at the bar, front and center.\\n\\nI hate to say this because I don\\'t remember this happening years ago when I went there. I was not even acknowledged. I get flagging down a bartender in a crazy busy bar in the South Side on a Friday night. I don\\'t like it but I get it. This was a moderately steady Thursday night. I wasn\\'t standing behind the people\\'s sitting at the bar. I was the person sitting at the bar. There were two male bartenders both bartenders asked the guy next to me multiple times if he wanted anything else to drink. \\n\\nBy \"multiple times\" I mean 6 or 8 times. The person sitting directly beside me. They wouldn\\'t look at me. I tried to make eye contact with either of them and it was as if I wasn\\'t even there. Eventually the boyfriend\\'s beer emptied as well. This is about 20 minutes after I arrived. I\\'ve had people walk in and stand behind us and the bar tender or waitress was on them immediately. After another 5 minutes of the boyfriend\\'s beer being perched precariously on the edge of the bar and the bartenders standing there chatting he had to ask the bartender for a refill and if I could have a drink.\\n\\nThe bartender looks up at him, grabs his pint glass angrily from the bar and says, \"Oh, you wanted another?\" \\n\\nReally? I was so angry at that point that it took everything I had not to ask the guy what his issue was.  I later saw him drop a pint glass and stumble into something so many he was drunk.\\n\\nThe food that other people ordered smelled and looked great. Even the seafoody bits which I normally hate smelling. The tv\\'s are plentiful and newer. I just don\\'t know if I\\'ll ever get to go back and try the food as I hate being slighted by a business owner and treated as if my business isn\\'t appreciated.'],\n",

Tonight, we sat outside and our waitress (Nikki) walked past us four times without making eye contact.  In fairness, I dont think it\\'s an issue with the waitress being bad as much as they really need to hire more waitresses, bc it seemed like there was only one waitress for the entire restaurant.\\n\\nOur tabletop was sticky and so after waiting for 20 min for service I decided I really needed a drink and went inside.  The bartender (Olivia) did not want to serve me bc we were sitting outside.  \"Your waitress will be right with you.\"  me:  \"But you are here now, can I please have a Shocktop Wheat?\"  \"Ill tell the waitress.\"  me:  \"Please may i just have my beer?\"  She served me, but then the waitress walked up to me and was like, \"Oh, I didn\\'t see you, weren\\'t you outside?\"  If you didn\\'t see me how would you notice I was outside?\\n\\nIts ok, I felt bad for her bc she was so busy but like--I\\'m easy to please.  All I needed was a beer.  I got one, so the waitress and I were then \"cool.\"  She then proceeded to never come back to our table, but that\\'s ok i think we pissed her off.\\n\\nThis has been a common thread:  not enough waitstaff so you have to beg for your food or drinks when the wait staff does come by.  It\\'s extremely frustrating.\\n\\nThe time before last we were there we ordered food and the waitress told us that we could expect to wait over an hour bc they had a group of 15 come in.  We thought she was kidding, and had our beers, so we rolled with it but she was not kidding.  We waitied over an hour for our food and the waitress made no apologies.  Also, our friend came and ordered food before ours came out, and this was around 10:30.  after waiting and waiting and waiting we asked the waitress for an ETA on his burger, but it turned out she forgot to put it in, and hte kitchen had closed.\\n\\nThe service sucks but what really sucks is the staff is never apologetic about it bc this place is a neighborhood bar w locals so they kind of dont care about apologizing bc they know you\\'ll be back.\\n\\nBut I come here bc like I said the food is ok, but you\\'ve got to come here and be very very patient.'],\n",

       "  u\"Silky's is my go to spot for a laid-back Friday night where you can have a few drinks and play some shuffle board without a crazy crowd. The place is never empty, but it's also never too full where you can't get a table. The crowd is a mixed bag, but like many bars in Pittsburgh, I've never felt out of place there.\\n\\nSilky's has a slightly above average tap list that often includes Southern Tier, Fat Heads, or Great Lakes. I have been disappointed several times when the tap list has changed but not the menu. I get my heart set on a beer, only to find out the keg has been tapped. No complaints though, there is always something else to try. \\n\\nI haven't had much food here, but the waffles fries are a great candidate for a late night bite.\\n\\nSilky's has several dart boards, and a shuffle board table along the window. If you get here early enough, you can get in a few shuffle board games before someone else takes a turn. \\n\\nWhen the weather is nice, the patio is a great option. There's potential for good people watching on Liberty Ave most days. However, asthmatics be forewarned, the bar is non-smoking, but the patio is not.\"],\n",

       "  u\"I was staying at a hotel nearby and was looking for a place close by for some food and drinks.  The hotel recommended heading down to Walnut street, but that seemed like a long walk.  I checked Yelp and saw that this place had some decent reviews, so thought I would give it a try.  There weren't too many people there when I walked in, so I went right up and sat at the bar.  I was greeted right away by the bartender (Bill).  He told me which three beers he was out of (which unfortunately were the three best ones on draft), then took my order.  I started with some wings and a beer.  I only order a half dozen of the atomic flavored wings which was unfortunate, as they were some of the best wings I've had in quite a while.  As a comparison, they weren't as hot as Buffalo Wild Wings 'hot' wings, but had decent heat and great flavor.  I then had another beer and ordered a meal they had on special.  It's not what I would call bar food by any means, as it was a perfectly cooked baked chicken with vegetables and potatoes.  I got a cup of cheddar and lager soup as part of the meal too which was wonderful.\\n\\nOverall, I was glad to stumble across this place.  As others mentioned, it seemed to tailor to an older crowd (30-49 seemed to be the median age when I was there).  I would have given it 5 stars had they been fully stocked on their draft beer.  I like to drink unique or uncommon beers when traveling and had to settle for Molson that night.\"],\n",

       "  u\"Until a few weeks ago the only time I'd been to Silky's was on a terrible date...he was a messy eater and generally ruined any good impression the place could have made on me. All that changed when my boyfriend and I decided to check it out for Sunday dinner one evening. We were very hungry and seeking a nice little neighborhood pub sort of place near our new house. I'm happy to say Silky's ended up being just what we were hoping to find!\\n\\nIt was dark and sort of cozy-feeling inside when we walked in. I liked how chill the vibe was. We immediately seated ourselves at a table to wait for the server. This might be a random observation, but I really appreciated the size of the tables for two. They could have probably fit four people but with only two seats it felt like there was actually enough room for plates and drinks and such. One of my biggest annoyances with eating at bars is getting an extraordinarily small, wobbly table. Our waitress came over pretty quickly and provided us with the draft list and specials for the night. The beer choices weren't amazing but certainly adequate for a neighborhood place. I ended up ordering the California chicken wrap with regular fries, and my boyfriend got chicken fingers with waffle fries. I absolutely loved my wrap and fully intend to order it again! It had guacamole, (an all too rare thing to find in wraps or sandwiches in Pittsburgh) bacon, general chunks of grilled chicken, and tomatoes. Those are four of my favorite foods, so I was very pleased with my choice. I eat my wraps with a knife and fork so I had no trouble with the messiness factor, but the wrap was quite large and I had leftovers for the following day. I enjoyed my boyfriend's waffle fries a little more than my plain ones however, so I'll probably get those next time. He said his chicken fingers were great. I'm sure we'll be back at Silky's very soon. Delicious food, awesome service, and close proximity to our home will make this a regular spot for the two of us.\"],\n",

The patrons know each other, the bartenders know the patrons, and if you are a stranger to the place they will get to know you too. \\n\\nGreat old time feel here with a wonderful ornate tile ceiling, brick walls, and a beautiful old bar. Beer prices are reasonable with a very wide selection of drafts and bottles, but are by no means the cheapest in the area. I haven't tried much of the food except for the wings, which are good and a safe bet if you don't know what to order. \\n\\nLot 17 is a PITT bar and a great place to watch a Saturday football game or a basketball game.

The look of the place is pretty decent with your standard bar seating but with the nice addition of an outdoor seating area which is great to people watch on the bussling streets of Bloomefield.\\n\\nI arrived last of my party and was starving, thankfully the group had ordered sweet potato fries that came with an amazing cinamon butter for dipping!! And here's where things went south- like I mentioned before I arrived starving and we did not see our waitress for a good 10-15 minutes. When the waitress finally arrived I ordered a diet coke which came out 5-10 minutes later and tasted flat (come on people! Change the machine!) The next time the waitress appeared I quickly ordered the tuna steak salad with cilantro lime dressing which was actually pretty good- it contained won ton strips, a pretty well done piece of tuna which I asked for medium, and an assortment of what tasted to be pretty fresh vegatables. \\n\\nAs we wrapped up the evening and received our checks we realized that the waitress didn't give me a bill but instead took it upon herself to add my salad to someone else's tab at my table without their heads up. \\n\\nSadly to say even though my salad was pretty decent, I'm going to have to give them just an ok review due to the terrible service..Here's to Lot 17..I hope you redeem yourself.\"],\n",

I used to live in Florida and survived on Mahi Mahi salads, sandwiches, and blackened fillets... \\n\\nAt lot 17 I am always ordering the blackened Mahi sandwich no bun with veggies,(usually broccoli or beans). This is a highly flavorful and tender good sized; piece of fish that had no fishy flavor. One of the mildest white fish. I have eaten it on the bun and it is very tasty too. The blackening can be a bit heavy and chard so if you don't like that burnt taste you may want to have it grilled. That spicy kick and filling but healthy selection keeps me going throughout the busiest of days!\"],\n",

Wood everywhere and one of the most amazing dual ceiling fans I've ever seen right over the bar.\\n\\nThe food is a surprising departure from regular bar food. Between the mahimahi sandwich with the amazing pineapple mayo spread or the salad with grilled tuna steak and homemade dressing you can't go wrong. \\n\\nThe atmosphere is generally laid back and I don't mean that in a snarky way. \\n\\nCalm, cool, collected, and CRISP.\"],\n",

When we arrived we were able to find seats at the bar since there was barely anyone there. They have a nice selection of draft beers. The food was definitely above average for a bar. The sweet potato fries are as good as advertised and the dipping sauce could be consumed with a straw but the TV selection leaves a little to be desired. I understand it is a PITT bar but with 95% of the bar focused on the LSU/Alabama game you would think they could have moved the PITT game to a corner TV and use the center TV with sound for the majority of the bar that was concerned in the 'Epic' game. They did switch the games around while PITT was at half but as soon as that game started the LSU game was back relegated to the corner. The manager even made some comment that our group didn't appreciate but whatever it's not like I will be back anytime soon. If you are looking for some good bar food I say stop on by. If you are looking to watch a big game outside of Pennsylvania sports you may want to choose elsewhere or be relegated to the corner without sound.\"],\n",

You can sit at any of a few high top tables, at the bar, or back in the back of the bar at a few booths. \\n\\nI\\'ve tried a few different appetizers in the few years I\\'ve been coming here. Standouts to me were the fried zucchini and the fried cheese wedges. These are somehow are leaps and bounds more delicious than any other fried goodies I\\'ve ordered at a bar. I\\'ve ordered a few different veggie options of entrees, of which they have a few tasty choices. The veggie burger is amazing, the veggie pita is nice crunchy mix of grilled veggies and asiago (mmm), and my new obsession is the Lot 17 salad, which I had never tried until recently. Wowwwwww. Huge portion, fresh berries, feta, fried leeks (!!!!), and a very fresh raspberry vinaigrette. \\n\\nDo yourself a favor, order anything. It\\'s ALL good. But don\\'t skip the fries. The regular fries are good. But I have no idea why you\\'d get those when you could get the cajun fries. They taste like the Andy Capp Hot Fries that you used to be able to get by the bag (I have no idea if you still can, don\\'t really care, these are better). Spicy and crispy and a nice accent to whatever you choose. Not your thing? Then the sweet potato fries should be perfect for you. So. Freaking. Good. And the brown sugar/butter sauce they are served with is like crack. I\\'ve tried to duplicate it at home with little success. Worth the trip alone. I\\'m salivating right now. \\n\\nThe staff is always friendly and helpful, service is usually great. A few TVs line this place so it\\'s a good place to watch a game.

       "  u\"Bloomfield has so many good places but in my book, Lot 17 stands above the typical bar and restaurant there. I WANT to go to Lot 17. First of all, it's a terrific atmosphere - one that makes you feel comfortable as soon as you walk in. A great beer selection with rotating specialities on tap always creates a welcoming feeling in my mind. But its the food that draws me back over and over and over again. The menu is predominantly sandwiches and wraps but the selection is VERY good. There are dinner entrees as well and I've ventured there a few times and was pleasantly surprised.. But the sandwich is king here. Oh yeah, I like 'em!! The jerk chicken with pineapple, provolone, and roasted red peppers is a HUGE hit. The crab cake sandwich is amazingly good - who would have thought?? The jalapeno steak wrap is so good I have a hard time straying from that. I've had about half the list and can tell you I've never regretted my choice. All very good. And they're not shy about size. You'll get full. I've tried their soups too and they're delightful and rich. Another winner. But I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the fries. Not just typical bar fries, but superb, specialty fries. Your choices are cajun, regular or sweet potato. The Cajuns are coated in a spicy dusting of Cajun seasoning. Yum. The sweet potato fries come with a brown sugar butter dipping sauce that will have you smacking your lip for hours afterwards. You'll wake up dreaming about that sauce. Addicting. I nominate Lot 17 for Best Bar Food in Bloomfield!!\"],\n",

Regular old fries, sweet potato fries or Cajun fries, it's so hard to pick the right one (or maybe an excuse to come back again and again and pair it up differently).\\n\\nOne thing that I always definitely do here is find the Pittsburgh Earthquake crack.

I wish that lark would have kept me going down Liberty Ave. to find somewhere else with tastier grub.\\n\\nWhen we walked into the restaurant, it was totally dead aside from one other table of diners. I figured the place should be bustling since it was such a delightful day outside, but I soon came to realize why the place was a ghost town.\\n\\nThe simple lunch menu of burgers, sandwiches, salads, and wraps is nice and compact. I chose a turkey burger and regular fries, which arrived in a timely fashion. The fries were tasty... after I salted them. There was absolutely no salt of them when they came out. The turkey burger was seasoned well, but it was dry as a bone. I suspect the turkey patty was frozen, but the burger was so overcooked, I cannot say for sure.\\n\\nOur server was attentive and friendly. The building is clean, polished, and has some nice HDTVs. \\n\\nWhen I chose  to go to Lot 17, I figured I was trying it out for the first time. After we ate lunch, I realized I had gone there once in the past for lunch with other co-workers. What does this mean? Lot 17 is ultimately a forgettable lunch destination.

I\\'ve lived in Bloomfield for two years now, and have yet to identify \"my spot.\"  I love the neighborhood -- great restaurants, bars, local business, art spaces, etc.  I like several of the bars, but just haven\\'t figured out which is my go-to spot.  \\n\\nLast night I asked a friend to meet me for a beer and she suggested Lot 17.  It is literally right around the corner from me.  (And when I say literally, I do NOT mean \"figuratively,\" which so many people do, by accident I suppose, but they\\'re saying exactly the opposite of what they mean! Grrr)  It\\'s right around the corner, and since I had actually never been in, I thought it was a perfect choice.\\n\\nThe first thing you notice is the classy wooden decor.  Everything is all really nice hardwood.  It has a very simple style -- the traditional wood, simple chalk board beer list, a couple of nice HD TVs -- none of which stands out or tries too hard to grab your attention.  The bar and a few tables are in the front while several more tables for dining line the back area.\\n\\nIt was nearly empty.  We were there late -- from about 10-11pm -- on a freezing cold Tuesday night.  A young couple sat quietly at the bar, another guy in the corner chatted up the bartender, and I grabbed a seat a little further down the bar.  I ordered a Full Pint Festivus draft, which is a great brown ale from a brewery in North Versailles that I\\'ve heard wonderful things about.  \\n\\nAfter a few sips my friend came in and joined me.  She had a Guiness, I had another Festivus, we chatted about this and that.  It was quiet, low key, and comfortable.  It\\'s a place that looks really nice yet had a friendly almost dive-y vibe.  I was only there for an hour and no one else was really there, so I shouldn\\'t jump to conclusions.  However, I will definitely be plopping myself down at that classic bar again in the near future, and who knows, maybe Lot 17 will become my neighborhood go-to spot for grabbing a beer on a whim.\\n\\nThere was a new, shiny, fancy looking, electronic jukebox that I will definitely have to give a try next time!

I enjoy a good chicken sandwich and their Jerk Chicken Sandwich with grilled pineapple, provolone and roasted red peppers may just be my favorite chicken sandwich ever! I've also had the crab cake sandwich which is pretty darned fantastic, too. The jalape\\xf1o steak wrap is so delicious and spicy that it also ranks near the top of delightful choices. It's real steak cooked to order inside, too. The fish tacos are also a tasty option.\\n\\nI'm not much of a French fry eater unless I'm at Lot 17. Their sweet potato fries are served with a side of brown sugar honey butter dipping sauce that I wish I could make at home. Tried and failed many times.

Occasionally it shows up runny or less than perfect & I get sad but its still better than my best attempt to copy it.\\n\\nBeer selection is good but could be more extensive.

After taking a moment to glance over the menu, we decided on the pita pizza app, the special (beer battered fish/Mac and cheese) and the fish tacos. \\nThe pita pizza: a soft pita shell with pesto, tomatoes, chicken and cheese. BORING. \\nThis appetizer reminded me of my mother\\'s Irish cooking: tasteless. A simple addition of caramelized onions would have solved this problem. \\nEntree 1: Beer battered fish and Mac and cheese. Ruling: BLAND. My husband ordered this one and described the fish as \"wet\" and the Mac and cheese as \"play-doh\". They also served the dish with lettuce, tomato and onion, as if it were a sandwich. \\nEntree 2: Fish tacos. Ruling: OVERCOOKED/COVER-UP ATTEMPTED. Ok, so they weren\\'t bad, but the fish was dry. Covered with tomatoes and a bit of lettuce, the tacos were, again, on the tasteless side. The attempt at adding flavor came with the chipotle mayo and sour cream. \\nThese only helped to moisten the fish.

Turkey club on focaccia (Our own oven roasted turkey breast, bacon, and Swiss cheese with lettuce and tomatoes served with a roasted garlic mayonnaise on focaccia) $8.50\\n2. Salmon BLT (Grilled salmon served on hoagie roll with dill mayo, bacon, lettuce, and tomato) $12.00\\n3. Grilled chicken wrap (Chicken breast, sundried tomatoes, olives and feta cheese wrapped in a spinach tortilla with balsamic dressing) $9.00\\n4. Calamari (Fried calamari served with peppers, onions, marinara sauce and lemon) $9.00\\n\\nMy favorite out of these would be the chicken wrap, although I wish the dressing was already inside the wrap because the wrap was packed so tightly it was difficult to get the dressing ratio right in the wrap. The turkey club also had a lot of flavor to it as well and the garlic mayo gave it a nice touch. The salmon BLT was not as good as the ones I have had at Piper's Pub but still adequate. I'm not a huge calamari fan so it was just ok for me. We will for sure be back in the future since this is a gathering place for my boyfriend and some of his friends.\"],\n",

       "  u\"This is more of an update to let everyone know Lot 17 has added several new menu items and I highly recommend returning (or making your first trip there) to check some of them out.  As far as apps go,  I tried the pot roast nachos this past weekend and if anyone is familiar with Atrias version (which is awesome-check those out too), this version is highly comparable. The jalepenos add a nice kick and the chips didn't become overly soggy from the meat, which was very tender. Sour cream and salsa are served on top and an order is huge-easily feeds 4 people. \\nThey have a couple of new sandwiches as well, a roasted Italian vegetable sandwich (I did not try this so can't really speak on the quality) and a smothered pot roast sandwich described as pulled short ribs with a marsala mushroom and\\nonion sauce topped with swiss cheese on a rustic roll. This was so juicy and flavorful and plenty to eat the next day too. There's also a new southwest turkey wrap (lettuce,tomato, corn salsa, fresh turkey, bacon and chipoltle ranch). The chipotle ranch added just the right amount of kick and I loved that the turkey they used was of the carvery style. I took half of this home and it was good reheated the next day. They also have a new short rib mac and cheese entree and a pretzel crusted salmon dish, one of which I will be getting on my next visit. Service was excellent as usual-Adrienne, whom I'd never had as a server there before, was quick to continuously serve with a smile. And it wasn't overly crowded on a Saturday night which was another plus. I'll return most likely sooner than later.\"],\n",

You\\'re going to eat there because you can get an enormous plate of breakfast and a bottomless cup of coffee for around $5. \\n\\nMa Roz will always make you feel at home, and she\\'ll remember you after your first or second visit, so that every time you come back, she greets you with a, \"Hey, where have you been?!?\" motherly scolding. \\n\\nThe food here is greasy, but it\\'s delicious. Expect to hear some good music, too (Bowie, Creedence, the Dead). In the wintertime, you can warm up by sitting at the counter across from the grill and watch your sandwich come to life in front of you. Just remember, it\\'s cash only.\\n\\nIf you\\'re coming in for lunch, and not breakfast, I recommend the fish sandwich. It\\'s of Lenten church fish fry quality, flaky and greasy and crispy all at once. Yummy. Just uh... don\\'t come here on a day when you want to eat healthy.

So naturally, we are hungry after escaping the hipsters of Remedy we are down for some regular chill.\\n\\nWe seat ourselves outside to wait out some of the crowd and drink the remainder of our 6 pack of PBR cans [remember we had just come from hipster/lawrenceville] when out of nowhere our simple pleasurable time is disturbed with the outbreak of a 10 person fight! [we got lucky because this is apparently unusual] -- there was even astonishment from the participants [\"REALLY? We are having a fight at the Sandwiche Shoppe????\" - yup pronounced that way]\\n\\nAnyways, there was much scramble to break up the fight and not stub out eyes with cigarette buds and the chefs did quite a job at driving the trouble makers away. Surprisingly, no cops came checking anything out just drove along liberty ave.\\n\\nNeedless to say this delayed our now greatly awaited sandwiches which we received for free in the process. [we tipped very well that night] The guy making our food brought us our food and engaged us in a friendly chat for about 15 minutes [much needed to restore his nerves].

       "  u\"I stopped by yesterday for brunch with CM around 1pm.  I'd passed the Bloomfield Sandwich Shop countless times on my bike, and had often wondered about the food and the clientele.  When a friend cancelled alternate brunch plans with my on Fri., but I was still craving breakfast food, the idea occurred to me to finally check this place out.  I'm very glad that I finally did, given the sandwich shop provided me with one of the most memorable brunches I've had in PGH.\\n\\nThis place is the definition of a hole-in-the-wall--it's very small inside, so expect to get cozy with the owners and other customers during your visit.  In true diner style, CM and I opted to sit at the counter.  Indeed, space was at such a premium that at a couple points, one of the owners placed dirty plates on the counter a bit closer than I'd like for a minute or two before proceeding to clean them.  As for the decor, the best way to describe it is flower child kitsch, with a dash of sports (indeed, surprisingly, the paper placemats contained sports trivia).  You really do feel as though you're in the owners' kitchen when you're here.  CM described it as organized chaos, which I thought was quite apt.\\n\\nAs for the food, as far as I can tell, the sandwich shop offers the most inexpensive breakfast in PGH (aside from McD's, etc.)--everything on the menu is $5 or less, and the portions are generous.  Despite this, as others have mentioned, the quality of the food is quite good--on par with, if not better than, Pamela's, and leaps and bounds above EnP.  CM ordered a hobo cake, a breakfast sandwich consisting of eggs and cheese between two pancakes ($4.50), with bacon (+ $1.25), and I ordered the short stack of pancakes ($4.25) with Nutter Butter cookies and chocolate chips (+ $1.00).  Both entrees were delicious, and very satisfying, not to mention filling.  (In fact, CM fell into a carb coma shortly after going back to his place.)\\n\\nAlthough the food and prices are great, what really makes eating at the sandwich shop a real experience is the owners, Mike and Mama Ros.  Mike, who waited on us, has a great sense of humor, joking with us and making us feel like family from the time we walked in the door to the time we left--and even afterward (he greeted us again when he and Mama Ros were taking a break at the outside tables as we walked past on our way back to the car after taking a short walk).  From talking to him, we learned that he and Mama Ros have run the sandwich shop for 15 years (impressive!), and that he lived in San Jose, CA prior to moving to PGH.  We didn't get to talk to Mama Ros much, because she was working the grill at the time we were there and it was quite busy, but they both seem like great people.\\n\\nNeedless to say, we had an awesome first experience at the Bloomfield Sandwich Shop, and look forward to returning for more.  While I'm tempted to award 5 stars, there were a few minor shortcomings on the food front (use of boxed pancake mix, lack of maple syrup), and the chaotic atmosphere may not be for everyone.  Having said that, if you're looking for cheap and plentiful portions of basic diner fare done well served up by friendly owners, check out this neighborhood institution--it won't let you down!  4.5 stars.\"],\n",

But come on people, who can actually write a review of an ITALIAN restaurant when they\\'ve only eaten the tuna or a hoagie? PASTA is in their name, so you should probably try the PASTA before commenting on something that isn\\'t their SPECIALTY. Sorry for the sarcasm.\\nI\\'ve been going to Alexander\\'s for years, and I can\\'t remember ever getting a bad meal. I love that you can pick what kind of pasta you want, what sauce, and the toppings. My favorite is the marfredo sauce. It is spaghetti sauce mixed with alfredo sauce. So freakin good!!! \\nMy only \"issue\" is that they never seem to add enough sauce on your pasta, but you can ask for some extra on the side and they bring you a little bowlful. It\\'s perfect!!!\\nI get hot sausage on top (which isn\\'t too spicy) and broccoli (which is always steamed just right, so it\\'s not limp). \\nThe bread always comes with olive oil and parmesean cheese that you can dip it in. I love that.  \\nWe always get a carafe of their Chianti. It seems to go really well with the pasta. \\nAnd lastly, the price is right. Why pay $20 for a plate of pasta? Alexander\\'s agrees.

       "  u\"Living in Bloomfield, I was excited to finally try some authentic, excellent Italian fare. Unfortunately, I hadn't had much luck so far at Pleasure Bar (okay food), or D'Amico's (awful food). I've had more consistent, tasty Italian at the Olive Garden, which is sad. So I decided to give Alexander's Italian Bistro a try.\\n\\nWe stopped in tonight, a Saturday evening. The place was pretty much full and we didn't have a reservation, but we got seated after just a few minutes. The tables are packed pretty tight and you can see the servers dancing around each other precariously. The decor is charming without being all tacky like other local Italian places...I love the beautiful backlit stained glass panels that open the space up. There is a nice little bar area in the front with a smaller bar food menu and a couple nice TVs...we'll have to check that out soon.\\n\\nMr. got the Eggplant Alexander, I got the Mafalda Alexander. The eggplant was nice and crispy, not mushy inside like eggplant parmesan can often turn out. It was very rich and definitely two meals worth of food. My pasta was excellent. The noodles were flavorful on their own, and cooked freshly and perfectly. I like the mafalda noodles, which aren't too commonly used in most Italian places. The sauce, a mixture of marinara and alfredo, was tasty and not overpowering. The spicy Italian sausage was soooo good...just the right amount of spicy, tender and flavorful. They give a pretty large basket of bread that is moist, fresh, and flaky.\\n\\nWe got the tiramisu for dessert, which was pretty good. It's hard to find real tiramisu anyways so I give them credit for having it. The ladyfingers were a little bit tough to cut with a spoon but they were good, and the cream was very good, not too sweet. A nice finish to the meal.\\n\\nOnly downsides...no soup or salad included with the dish, those are extra. Our server was nice enough but kinda disappeared when we were finished with our food...we waited around a good 15 minutes for her to come back and wrap Mr.'s leftovers and ask if we wanted dessert, then another 10 minutes after finishing dessert for her to come back with the check. This is one of my top pet peeves.\\n\\nAlexander himself (I'm pretty sure anyway...) stopped by the table at the end of our meal to ask how everything was, which is always a nice touch in my book. Everyone working there seemed like they must be family, but not the type of family who dread working for the family business, which is nice.\\n\\nWe'll definitely be back.\"],\n",

I have eaten at Alexander's several times and the food and wait staff have always been spot on. My favorite dish is the Mafalda Alexander (Mafalda pasta, sausage, and a tomato cream sauce). They give you an un-eatably huge portion which is fine by me, it makes a great lunch the next day. Also, I think the decor and prices make this a great spot for a date night. One minor flaw is that the only parking is metered street parking. It's usually not a problem finding a spot relatively close, however I have run into issues in the past.\"],\n",

       "  u'I\\'m sorry, this place is simply not good. Unfortunately, it is yet another example of poorly made Americanized Italian food. Too much cheese, too much butter and cream, and quite possibly the worst bread I have ever consumed at any Italian restaurant in my life. \\n\\nSomeone had to go out of their way to find bread this flavorless and awful. It\\'s already a travesty that it\\'s served to me before the meal, but to put it on my sandwich! I\\'m actually offended for Italians, and bread. Yes bread, this is not your best. The eggplant Parmesan served to my mother was soggy, covered with an absurd amount of plastic Parmesan cheese swimming in a bland sauce. My fathers pasta, cream and cheese. Contrary to popular believe, this is not traditional Italian! This is what some would refer to as, terrible and heavy. And the cannoli? Words could not describe my disappointment.\\n\\nI\\'ll admit it, I\\'m already an Italian food snob. I cook tons of Italian food for myself, family, and friends, and I only use the highest quality ingredients and go about preparing my meals in traditional southern Italian ways. I\\'ve had phenomenal Italian meals at the few great Italian restaurants in this city, so whenever I get the opportunity to eat at another \"Italian\" joint, I\\'m heading in with high expectations.\\n\\nIs this what Italian food in Pittsburgh has come too? Seeing other similar Italian places in Bloomfield, I\\'m sad to say...yes. I\\'m actually slightly upset even writing this because the waitstaff is charming, and I hear the owners are great, but to pass this off as representative of Italian food is an injustice. If you want a truly great Italian meal please look elsewhere.'],\n",

They also offer a side house salad which is also really good (they use dried cranberries and candied walnuts, mmmm!!!). I'm not a huge fan of wedding soup, but Alexander's has one of the best.The mac n' cheese is fabulous as well. Everything here is. Nothing is done cheap. The atmosphere is dimly lit and romantic, I suppose, the bartenders are sweet and conversational, and the servers are timely, polite and very friendly. They have outside seating available, weather permitting. Decent drink specials and a variety to choose from. Alexander (the owner) is such a nice guy, he goes out of his way to make the customers happy. I feel like I'm at home here.

       "  u'So a friend and I went to Alexander\\'s because it was the closest restaurant to his place and we didn\\'t feel like driving on the snow-covered roads.  I didn\\'t have high expectations - I thought I would get standard Italian fare with nothing special while also probably paying too much.  From the get go I was wrong!\\n\\nThe decor and ambiance isn\\'t upscale but it also isn\\'t terrible.  It feels like a down home, mom and pop type of restaurant.  It sort of reminded me of a place that Tony and his crew would eat at in \"The Sopranos\" - good food and cool ownership.  When we entered, it looked like the owner was chatting it up with some regulars.  Seeing us, he warmly greeted us and introduced us to our waitress.  Before I get to the food a note on the service.  Our waitress was great - super friendly, helping us with any questions, and checking up on us during our meal just enough to feel taken care of but not intrusive by any means.  I could tell this wasn\\'t her first rodeo.\\n\\nThe food was spot on.  Along with our menus, we got a basket full of fresh Italian bread and butter.  The bread was standard white but it was moist and tasted very fresh.  But you know how it is - don\\'t fill up on bread!  Perusing the menu, they had a lot of variation which I love - chicken marsala, spaghetti, etc but the chicken parmigiana sandwich was calling my name.  It came on hearty bread strong enough to hold the sandwich and not fall apart.  The best part was the chicken which was crispy!  It came with what tasted like homemade sauce and cheese.  It\\'s a simple meal but very tasty - you bite into it and first get the slightly sweet sauce and cheese then the hearty chicken.  Mmmm.\\n\\nThe sandwich was around $9 and it came with fries.  A very good and hearty meal.  I look forward to trying some of the other options at Alexanders the next time around!'],\n",

       "  u\"Stopped in for dinner on a Sunday night at 7pm and Alexander's was about half full. We decided to go simple and stick with the Pastabilities. I choose the Bolognese with penne  (~$12) and mushrooms (extra $1.50), while my husband ordered the Marfredo with farfelle ($11), sundried tomatoes and hot sausage (extra $4). Bolognese was solid though lacked mushrooms and my husband's dish was tasty too though the hot sausage was bland, it needed salt. Portions are huge, mine was easily two meals. Italian bread or rolls (not warmed up) w/ butter balls comes with the meal and there is EVOO on the table. For dessert, we ordered the chocolate chip cannolli which came with two - we enjoyed them but it pricey for the size $7. Aside from the dessert, the meal was reasonably priced.\\n\\nService was consistent with other Yelpers' reviews - really, really friendly. We liked our waitress. Because there were no mushrooms in my dish, she was suppose to take it off our bill but forgot so ended up giving a cash credit. Also I ended up packaging my Bolognese home since I couldn't eat it all and she asked if we wanted the rolls too and wrapped my pasta in saran wrap for the trip home to prevent any sauce spillage which was a smart move since we had walked here.\\n\\nOne comment though would be on the decor. You walk in and the bar area somewhat has a modern feel but then once you go into the dining room it is like you are warped back into time. There is just a lot of visual stimulation - over the top - that just doesn't go together.\\n\\nOverall though, Alexander's just gets it done - nothing fancy w/ home style food and  great prices and service. We'll be skipping other Italian places in the area and will be back again.\"],\n",

I was impressed at how many healthier options they had, if that's what you're in the mood for. Or pig out on a hot plate of carbs and dairy with a side of italian sausage.\\n\\nMy friends and I split an order of beans, greens and tomatoes. I regret the sharing part, it was so outrageously delicious I wanted it all to myself. Next time I'm getting my own.\\n\\nIn the spirit of healthy eating, I went with a salad, which was big, fresh, and just what I wanted. If you like salad, you're set. If not, the pasta my friends had looked great too. You can get gluten free or whole wheat pasta for an additional charge if you like. My boy friend had angel hair with alfredo, our friend had linguini marinara with fried calamari.\\n\\nThe waitress was very pleasant, and kept her cool even though she had the pleasure of serving this merry band of drunk, vicious old queens.\\n\\nNow I would have been sold on the service and the food, everything I tasted was great. But the two pasta dishes weren't all that hot. Somewhat warmer than warm, they said. My friend let the waitress know but wasn't unhappy enough to send it back, even though the manager was adamant they could remake  the plate in no time. (I work in a customer based industry and I know first hand, nothing can be worse than an unhappy customer who isn't willing to let you fix the problem after they bring it to your attention.) So at the end of the meal, he offered to buy us a round of drinks instead. Smart guy - offer a couple of drunks some free liquor, and all is forgiven. He took an almost great meal and made it great for them. Sadly, I was driving so didn't take him up on the offer. \\n\\nSo - great food, beans and greens, lots of choices, beans and greens, good service, and beans and greens.

Full disclosure:  I was dying at the end of a long urban hike, and we were right next to Alexander's and I told my friend I would hate him forever if he did not buy me pasta RIGHT.NOW.  :)  \\n\\nAlexander's totally hit the spot.  It was so good!  I was really surprised!  I had the chicken bruschetta and it was DELCIOUS.  I'd had the same item at Del's a few weeks ago and Del's cannot hold a candle to Alexanders.  My chicken breast was only slightly seasoned which is a sign of a good, confident chef.  The chicken was delicious and perfect and came out tasting like well seasoned chicken, not salt.\\n\\nIt came with a side of pasta in any sauce I wanted from their lengthy list of sauces.  I chose penne in gorgonzola cream sauce.  The gorgonzola sauce was extremely strong.  VERY cheesy.  I like gorgonzola, but it was a bit strong for me--although it was still very good.\\n\\nMy friend had a spaghetti and marinara in the marinara was incredible.  You can tell its made on site.  It was excellent.  \\n\\nOur entrees came with side salads which were very good, and there was bread nad oil on the table for dipping although we didn't get into that too much.

       "  u\"Alexander's is good, solid Italian food without any pretentiousness. Their menu is large, but not outrageously expansive like a lot of other local Italian restaurants in the area. There's a nice selection of Italian favorites, plus you have the ability to create your own past dish (choose your pasta, type of sauce, and add-ons).\\n\\nI've been to Alexander's several times for lunch and always enjoyed it, so I decided to take my girlfriend there for dinner on a recent night. When we entered, we were warmly greeted by the staff and asked where we wanted to sit. We sat in the front of the house/bar area so I could keep an eye on the Pirates game. While there, I overheard an older lady complaining that her dish was less than stellar. The server and the manager agreed with her assessment and offered to make her anything else on the menu to make her happy. I've always been pleased by the pleasant, accommodating nature of the staff when I've visited Alexander's; it's truly a strong point of the restaurant.\\n\\nI ordered the pork osso bucco with garlic risotto, while my girlfriend went with chicken parmigiano. We opened with bruschetta toast. It was a nice start. The tomatoes were fresh, and the taste of balsamic vinegar gave it a little pop of flavor. I then had their wedding soup, which is always enjoyable. It's full of meat and has just the right level of saltiness to it. My girlfriend was pleased with her garden salad; in particular, she enjoyed the flavor and texture added by walnuts and cranberries.\\n\\nThe pork osso bucco I received was huge. Unfortunately, the flavor was not as big as the size of the dish. The pork was tender and properly cooked... the garlic risotto, not so much. It was just kind of bland. Together, the dish was fairly tasty, but not something that I would order again. My girlfriend was pleased with her massive serving of chicken parmigiano and pasta. It was good, but the breading was a little soggy because it was doused in sauce.\\n\\nSomewhere during the course of our dinner, the manager walked from table to table, and asked every group if they wanted a loaf of Italian bread. I suppose that they had a lot of extra bread and were giving it out since the night was winding down. I heartily accepted- their bread is delicious. Little things like this are why I love Alexander's.\\n\\nIf you're looking for some tasty Italian food served in a friendly, welcoming atmosphere, you can't go wrong with Alexander's. Just stick with the pasta, and you'll be happy.\"],\n",

       "  u\"I have been coming to Alexander's  off and on for almost 25 years. I think in all that time I have only had one meal that was below par. Pretty good average I'd say. I went the other night with my adult daughter. I had the calamari with pasta, a cocktail ( yum, yum), and a garden salad. The salad was very fresh and arrived promptly. The cocktail was strong but great. The calamari arrived quickly and was piled so high on the plate I could barely see over the plate! It was served on what tasted like fresh tomatoes over the pasta. It was so good I couldn't stop eating it, even after I was full. \\n\\nMy daughter had the salad too with linguini and clam sauce. It was loaded with clams. They were tasty and not rubbery. She suspected they were canned but since they were tender it was okay. The sauce was fragrant too, not fishy. \\n\\nOur server was super efficient and polite. She kept up with us without being intrusive. The decor of the restaurant has been updated a bit over time. It's cute. A bit too bright for an Italian restaurant if you ask me, but I'm from New England where Italian places are all dimly lit. \\n\\nOverall, a wonderful, easy going, friendly  neighborhood place to go to relax over some good food and drink. Have a few laughs without a tv interrupting your dinner conversation. You have to sit in the bar for that. Take your mom. Take the family. Take your husband when you can't stand another night of cooking. Just go it alone and who cares about anyone else?! Just have fun eating some really good food that tastes like someone cares.\"],\n",

       "  u'I AM BOYCOTTING ALEXANDER\\'S FOR LIFE!!! The manager SCREAMED AT ME at the top of his lungs in an epic meltdown that lasted 10 minutes! \\n\\nOn Sat., April 12, 2014, I attended the 50th birthday party for my dear friend, David Flynn. I organized the party, but relied on Dave and his sister to provide me with the final head count. I made the reservation for 25 people.\\n\\nThe manager and I played phone tag for the two days before the event. I called back and left messages TWICE to confirm, but apparently he never got my messages. (This was part of his rant, his indignation at unreturned phone calls that actually HAD been returned!)\\n\\nThe dinner started at 7 PM. Most of our group arrived on time, but some of our group (including me) arrived between 8 PM-9 PM. I was working on a homemade birthday present for Dave, which took longer than expected. I called Dave, his sister and my friends (Reesa & Joel) to tell them I was running late. In hindsight, I should have also called the restaurant to let them know, and for that I am truly sorry. That still doesn\\'t justify the manager SCREAMING AT ME FOR 10 MINUTES!\\n\\nAfter enjoying a delicious dinner, drinks and birthday cake, none of us had a clue that anything was wrong. If the decision to return to a restaurant were based SOLELY on the food and wait staff, I would definitely return to Alexander\\'s. But sadly, when the manager has a nuclear meltdown and throws a 10-MINUTE SCREAMING TEMPER TANTRUM, it tends to sour one on returning to a restaurant.\\n\\nTowards the end of our dinner, some of us started to smell cigarette smoke, which we later realized was coming from the patio out front. (It was a warm night, and they had the front sliding-glass doors open.) In the midst of the smoke discussion, the manager approached our table and began an EPIC RANT, SCREAMING AT ME FOR 10 MINUTES!!!\\n\\nHe was angry that everyone in our group hadn\\'t arrived at exactly 7 PM. The restaurant\\'s kitchen is open till 10 PM on Sat. night, so I don\\'t understand why this was a big deal. We ended up with 20 people total and 5 no-shows. I am always disappointed by no-shows, but I explained this possibility to the manager when I made the reservation. I STILL BROUGHT HIM 20 PAYING CUSTOMERS! \\n\\nBTW...the dining room was practically EMPTY, which is not what I would expect on a Saturday night in Pittsburgh. Maybe I\\'m not the first customer to be on the receiving end of the manager\\'s meltdown.\\n\\nThe manager SCREAMED that he had called me twice, and I hadn\\'t called him back! He ranted about this about a dozen times. I told him I HAD called him back - TWICE. It\\'s not my fault if he didn\\'t get my messages. \\n\\nHe SCREAMED that he had put an extra waitress and cook on staff because he expected 25 people. He SCREAMED that I had cost the restaurant $100! How much money do you think 20 people spent on appetizers, dinner and drinks? I find it hard to believe that they didn\\'t make any money, or at least break even. \\n\\nI am sorry that there were 5 no-shows in our group, but I always thought Saturday night was the busiest night of the week for most restaurants. I didn\\'t realize the restaurant would look like a deserted, old western ghost town with hardly any customers. On a Saturday night, I assumed they would have a full staff on duty with or without my reservation. I was wrong. I\\'m sorry. I\\'m not perfect.\\n\\nThe manager also YELLED at me and my friends for \"LOOKING COMFORTABLE\" in his restaurant!!! Since when is looking comfortable an OFFENSE??? I thought restaurants wanted you to feel comfortable, but apparently not at Alexander\\'s.\\n\\nHe also SCREAMED that one of the waitresses only got a $1.00 tip! I found that hard to believe, but just in case he wasn\\'t making it up, I tipped my waitress $35 on my $26 dinner check! I am a former waitress, and I would feel HORRIBLE if any waitress every got ripped off on my watch! Even if his story wasn\\'t true, I figured she deserved an extra big tip just for having to WORK in such a horrible place where the manager YELLS at paying customers!!! If he treats the customers this way, I can only imagine how he treats the employees. \\n\\nTHE MANAGER\\'S RUDE BEHAVIOR HAS COST HIM MY BUSINESS AND MY FRIENDS\\' BUSINESS FOREVER!!! During his rant, he actually SCREAMED that he never wanted to see me in his restaurant ever again! I\\'m happy to grant him that wish. And so are my friends. \\n\\nThis is an example of the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I have ever witnessed in my entire life!!! I thought the manager was going to have a heart attack or a stroke the way he was SCREAMING FOR 10 MINUTES!\\n\\nSCREAMING at paying customers is completely unacceptable behavior, and I will NEVER eat at Alexander\\'s ever again. It\\'s really a shame because I loved their salmon with pesto sauce. But great food can\\'t make up for a manager who throws a TEMPER TANTRUM and SCREAMS AT YOU. Also, you can smell smoke in the dining room, which sucks. My friends and I are BOYCOTTING ALEXANDER\\'S FOR LIFE!!!'],\n",

       "  u'My husband and I had one of our first dates in Pittsburgh at Alexander\\'s, so it has a special place in my heart.  I knew he was a keeper when we ordered the asparagus/goat cheese appetizer and I loved it so much that he let me eat all but one piece on my own.  \\n\\nThere is a bar areas out front that has a more casual feel and dining room in the back.  The dining room is small and intimate offering several booths along the sides of the restaurant and several tables in the middle and towards the front of the dining room.  The decor has a homey feel with nice colors and a fun chandelier.\\n\\nThe menu is much more extensive then a typical Italian restaurant.  There are several appetizer choices in addition to the previously mentioned grilled asparagus.  There are also several salads and two soup options, the soup of the day and wedding soup.  \\n\\nThe first time I was there I tried the veal diablo which was veal with hot peppers and mushrooms and a Marsala sauce.  It was delicious.  It had a nice kick but wasn\\'t too hot that you didn\\'t enjoy it.  On my second visit I enjoyed the \"pastabilities\" create your own pasta.  With 10+ sauce choices plus 10+ pasta the combinations seem endless!  I enjoyed the angel hair with the Marsala wine and red pepper sauce.  My husband had the Bolognese and was equally happy.  The pasta seemed to be in an endless bowl.  I felt like I was eating forever and there was still two meals worth of pasta left in my take out container.  The build your own pasta is quite a value for the price (although it does not come with a soup or salad like the other entrees do).  \\n\\nWe were stuffed, but after seeing several desserts go by, I decided I wanted to order the Napoleon.  It was stuffed with strawberries and blueberries and the cream was delectable.  \\n\\nOverall a great dining experience.  We will be back.'],\n",

It wasn't overly breaded and were were able to split it between six people and not worry about not having enough.

Wedding soup was a bit salty, but otherwise perfectly fit my conception of what wedding soup should be.  Dad had the tortilla soup (I know; odd choice) and he liked it quite a bit.  Standout item was the beans & greens which were very fresh.  Service was excellent.

       "  u\"This is my go-to for good, unpretentious, Italian-American home cooking. Alexander's is  the place where the locals go for an inexpensive meal. The dining room is small and decorated to look like an Italian trattoria. The menu has all the basics, tons of pastas, different sauces, meatballs, parmigiana, etc. The bread is from (I'm pretty sure) Mancini's which is an old Italian-American bakery in the city. Come as you are: jeans, Steelers jersey, college sweatshirt, what have you. The service can be a bit flaky, but everyone is quite nice. Just relax. If they mix up an order they'll make it right. I love the wedding soup here and they make awesome chicken piccatta. I also like how they serve the meat and pasta dishes separately on small plates, instead of dumping everything together on a big dinner plate. For dessert they make a real tiramisu with lots of rum, and also really good rice pudding. One warning: it is really easy to overeat here. I eat lightly during the day if I know I'm going to Alexander's for dinner.\"],\n",

I got the tortellini with pesto and my mother got the gnocchi with red pepper sauce. The pesto was more like an Alfredo sauce with pesto in it. Although not what I expected, it was amazing. The red pepper sauce was sweet and tangy, a little different but still very enjoyable.\\nAll of the courses came out quickly- we were there for less than an hour.

Our waitress showed us to a booth in the back where they were scraps and trash under and around our table. I asked her for a drink list she informs me there isn't one k fine I move on. Then we get an appetizer the fried ravoli which was prices at 8$ but only came with four bite size pieces on a plate. That's it. Now onto the meal I order a tortellini and marinara and my husband got the tuna. Mine came out with random mixed veggies In it(which I just picked around) and my husbands came out fine except his sauces came in plastic cups(it was a 20$ dish). Oh and that's not the end of it. After telling the waitress that I didn't receive what I ordered we had to listen to her and the cook scream at each other while we at. She then have us our check and then disappeared.

       "  u'Alexander\\'s offers some of the worst Italian food I\\'ve ever had. I went there with my girlfriend and my parents on a Saturday night, and from start to finish the experience that Alexander\\'s gave us was simply awful. First, when we arrived around 6 pm, the restaurant was half-empty (bad sign #1). The hostess seated us at a table in the center of the very cramped and very small dining room (bad sign #2). Then, our waitress did not even come over to take drink orders for another 10 minutes (bad sign #3).\\n\\nOnce the waitress finally arrived and took our orders, the food itself offered no relief. My girlfriend and I ordered the Caesar salad - the salads were drowning in Caesar dressing, the croutons were badly burnt and inedible, and there were too many croutons to begin with. This restaurant couldn\\'t even get a simple salad right, but I hoped against hope that the entrees would be an improvement.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the entrees were no better. My girlfriend ordered Chicken Alfredo. Not only was the dish absurdly light on chicken (3 small pieces total? Come on!), the alfredo sauce was thick and gummy to the point of tasting like glue. My mom ordered the Mushroom ravioli, which was completely bland. I ordered the Veal Diablo with Shrimp; the plate came with 3 pieces of veal sliced extremely thin, 3 nice sized shrimp, and... that was it. No pasta, no garlic bread, nothing but an ocean of very mediocre marinara sauce. I finished my entire plate, the remaining half of my mom\\'s plate after she was finished eating, and as much as I could stomach of my girlfriend\\'s Alfredo (which was only a couple of forkfuls, as that Alfredo sauce was one of the foulest things I\\'ve ever eaten), but I still was left hungry.\\n\\nThe dessert course offered a distinctly rotten cherry on top of this already heaping garbage sundae. We were initially assured that all of the desserts were made in-house, but that soon proved not to be the case. Indeed, for several of our desserts, a store-bought version would have been an improvement. I ordered a cannoli, figuring that even a crappy Italian restaurant can\\'t screw up a cannoli, as it is a violation of Italian Law or something. Unfortunately, their \"fresh-made\" cannolis consisted of a pre-packaged cannoli shell, pre-packaged cannoli filling (which, by the way, was gritty, as though someone had dumped in white sugar but not mixed the cream thoroughly enough for the sugar to dissolve), and put the two together in the kitchen. Needless to say, my cannoli was awful. My girlfriend ordered the tiramisu, and what she received was about as far removed from tiramisu as one can get. There were almost no ladyfingers, and the ones that were in the dish were drowning in coffee. On top of that, the dessert was swamped with an excessive amount of coffee-flavored cream that essentially destroyed the dish. My uncle\\'s chocolate cake was dry and uninspiring; a store-bought cake would have been more moist.\\n\\nI did not pick up the check - my uncle was nice enough to do that - so I did not see the final bill. However, they could not have paid me to eat this often-inedible food. The service was slow and inattentive, the food was simply awful, and I left hungry. Do not waste your time, your money, or your energy with this place, as you can get better Italian food virtually anywhere else in the city.'],\n",

We were talking about places to eat and I of course mentioned and suggested Thai Cuisine, knowing how good their food is.  My sister was skeptical, to say the least, mentioning in the same breath that she lives in the San Francisco area, could a place in Pittsburgh actually be that good if not better than restaurants in CA?  I decided to let the food speak for itself  --- and it did!  My sister ordered the red curry (duck with pineapple), her fave dish, and she LOVED it.  In fact, she admitted after that this restaurant was indeed the best she had had - and that it was too bad that it was in Pittsburgh.  \\n\\nMe personally?  I love the green curry with mock duck (wheat gluten) - and I am not vegan or vegetarian.  I would like to mention that this restaurant has a nice selection of vegetarian and vegan options.  The crispy spring rolls are yummy, especially with the sauce.  The soups are all pretty great.  \\n\\nYou should try this restaurant, it will definitely be worth your time.

The place is BYOB, which means you can have a fancy meal on the cheap. They have a great veg menu, it's not over saturated with fake meat, or light on the protein. Their menu strikes a great vegetable/protein balance for non-meat eaters, and it looks like it does the same for omnivores.\\n\\nThe price is great too, you can get plenty of food for about $10 per person (not including tip or drinks)\"],\n",

I had to wait 15 minutes for a table.  I always feel waiting for a table is more of a positive than a negative as it usually means good things are to come.  I started out with the special shrimp fried in wontons.  It was unmemorable and I would of like to have seen bigger shrimp for this 6.95 appetizer.  I ordered the vegetable tom yum soup.  This was outstanding.  The vegetables were large and fresh and the spice was perfect.  I asked for medium and actually got medium.  I went with the standard pineapple curry as i always do the first time at a thai place.  Every bite was enjoyable and again the medium spice was perfect.  Like so often at thai restaurants i am always sad when i get to the bottom of the bowl.    Looking forward to my next visit. (4.5 stars)'],\n",

I just like it. #2 - the prices are so cheap.

The competition is serious; both places have excellent food and both are a long way from pretentious dining.  After a few experiences at each, Thai Cuisine emerged as the winner.  This is mainly because 1) I had the lights turned out on me (twice) without warning at Thai Gourmet - as in \"hey we\\'re closing but instead of telling you, we\\'re just going to turn out the lights, hint hint\" and 2) I was served by a 10 year old on more than one occasion.

My fried trout was just a battered butterflied fish not much different from what you'd find at a church fish-fry. Insipid, over-battered and generally unpleasant. My dining partner's masaman curry was so sickly sweet it tasted like melted coconut ice cream. Surprisingly, the joint was slammed. \\n\\nOn the bright side, service was very fast. On the downside, our waitress was definitely stressed out and cranky possibly from waiting on the 14-top of inebriated co-eds across the room from us.\\n\\nThe takeaway: If you're from Pittsburgh, you'll probably love this place -- it was packed with your kinsmen when I was there.

A friend brought me there for lunch back in 2006 - and I have been a junkie ever since.  And, to be perfectly honest, I have only found one other place in the burgh that I think has comparable food in terms of taste - and the prices there are much higher.  We live about 45 minute drive from TC so for us to frequent there means that we really do enjoy the food!\\n\\nOver the years, DH and I have brought many friends to TC.  To be honest, it is not much to look at.  It really is lacking in atmosphere and, to be honest, I would love to see them clean up their restrooms a lot.  But the service is always good and the food - well, the food is so good, I can live with this little \"diner\".  Besides, we always end up down the street afterwards for a coffee and there are restrooms there :)\\n\\nWe have tried all of the appetizers - DH says it is hands down the best hot & sour he has ever had.  Steamed dumplings are the tastiest in town - good taste but nothing overwhelming (i have had them with so much garlic, I regret eating them). Spring rolls are always tasty & fresh.  BTW - if you go at lunch, they add a tiny salad with peanut dressing to your plate - try not to lick the plate when you are done :)\\n\\nI think we have tried every curry on the menu - red, green, pineapple, panang, musman, winter.  Winter is always our favorite - a green curry with the pumpkin is to die for.  DH will scrape the bowl on this one. \\n\\nI am a noodle junkie.  My favorite here of all the dishes is their Pad See Ew.  I always get it with shrimp which are nice-sized and plentiful.  It is the sauce that differentiates this from other Thai places.  TC uses a sweet black bean sauce that is amazing.  I have tried this dish and it is the sauce that makes this dish.  I have liked their Rad Na and enjoyed the fried rices but I always come back to the Pad See Ew because I know that I can\\'t find comparable anywhere else.\\n\\nI will admit that we have never tried desserts there. To be honest, we find the portions plentiful and have never wanted dessert afterwards.\\n\\nIf you are looking for atmosphere, head to Squirrel Hill or the South Side or Wexford. If you are looking for tasty food at a reasonable price, this is your spot.  And just remember - there is always takeout!'],\n",

I tried everything at a 4, which I felt was just fine.  It wasn't bland, but I wasn't panting.  Our server said that around a 7 is when things start to get seriously spicy, so go ahead and order in that range if you are brave!\\n\\nI had the garlic pepper pork (my favorite Thai meal) for an entree.  It was incredible, salty and garlicky and the white rice was puffy and just the tiniest bit sticky in that perfectly-prepared way.  Lots of good chunks of veggies on the plate as well, and enough sauce to spread on your rice (and enough food to have leftovers for lunch the next day!).  My husband got the pork fried rice, and it was a huge, tasty portion.  Thankfully, the servers were quick with water refills, because all that saltiness makes you thirsty!\\n\\nAnother perk - Thai Cuisine is BYOB!  I truly wish we'd planned on our visit last night, so we could have brought a bottle of wine with us (the closest liquor store is down on Butler Street, so a bit of a hike if you're walking), but we just happened to be in the area when my Thai food craving hit.  I am so glad Thai Cuisine was there to supply the delicious food that I needed!\"],\n",

       "  u\"This is my local Thai food place. It's not necessarily my favorite, or the best around but here's why I like it:\\n\\n-It's good. I've liked everything I've ordered.\\n-It's dependable. Things are consistently good, and I order here fairly often.\\n-They usually get the spice right (of what you ask for on a scale of 1-10)\\n- It's better than the other one that is a block away. I don't know what other people have to say about this because I hear conflicting opinions of Thai Cuisine and Thai Gourmet, but I have tried them both and can say that I just like this one more. \\n\\nMy favorite dish is the green curry. Most veg packed and the tofu option is a great combination (I'm not a veg, but I eat veg often). I really like the way their tofu is steamed, its creamy and delicious in the thin curry sauce. I usually prefer a thicker curry but something about this curry really works as a thin texture - pretty soupy. But it's light and delicious and I am usually drinking it out of the bottom of my bowl like soup. \\n\\nI get take-out here quite often, and it is always ready fairly quickly, but I really wish they would deliver so I would not have to move my lazy, hungover ass out of my house. \\n\\nThe dining experience is OK. BYOB is a great plus, but the interior leaves a lot to be desired. The service is always great. Friendly and accommodating and the manager is always there to greet with a smile.\"],\n",

The name says it all--straight-up, no frills Thai. They aren't trying to do anything creative or fusiony, they just make good food. First things first, I'm obsessed with fresh spring rolls so for a restaurant to become my primary Thai destination, it has to get those right. Thai Cuisine's are not the best I've ever had, but they are definitely up there as one of my favorites in Pittsburgh. Soft, fresh, and big...nothing's worse than a puny spring roll that is practically frozen from sitting in a refrigerator all day (ahem...Thai Place). So since Thai Cuisine passes the spring roll test, I can talk about their other food, which is all delicious. My favorite is the Pineapple Curry, but I've liked everything I've tried here. If you're one of those people who doesn't venture past Pad Thai, don't worry, that's good too. As a bonus, the portions here are pretty large so the prices are pretty reasonable for the amount of food you get.\\n\\nThe most reliable Thai place I've found so far in the city (although I haven't tried them all yet).\"],\n",

Bonus points! Being totally committed to trying Pad Thai at every Thai place in the Burgh, you know what I ordered. Okay, you really want to know? Pad Thai with shrimp.\\n\\nSo here's the thing. I really liked the Pad Thai noodles and sauce. It was a huge portion that I ate entirely (lay off me, I'm starving!!) and it was very saucy (just the way I like it!). I was not into the shrimp. It tasted fishy. Like suspicious fishy. I couldn't put my finger on it. Was it unfrozen recently? Did it have freezer burn? Was it sitting out too long? I couldn't tell. But the one thing I knew was that it was not fresh. Bummer. It also came with this weird side salad on the plate. It was had a really thick, almost disgustingly so, peanut dressing with a touch of iceberg lettuce. I took a couple bites and gave up.

With that being said I was hoping that all my stumbling around in the elements would not be in vain.   \\n\\nThe food at Thai Cuisine is more pitiful than my sense of direction. I ordered Threes Company: shrimp, scallops and calamari in a Thai chili sauce. The sauce is my favorite part of a Thai meal but Thai Cuisine came up short here. What I enjoy must about a Thai chili sauce is the complexity of flavors but this sauce in my dish was your standard thin runny brown sauce.  The kind that comes with lets say beef and broccoli.  I think the menu description was misleading and had I known it would be brown sauce I would have ordered something else.  \\n\\nSome of the onions in my dish were cold which leads me to believe that the food was not cooked to order or at least not all of it.  There was plenty of shrimp in the dish and the calamari tasted great, but the dish lacked flavor. The carrots and broccoli was cooked beyond recognition.\\n\\nFor my hubby I ordered the Thai steak , it tasted like a frozen salisbury steak dinner and salisbury steak just so happens to be one my least favorite foods.

Everything is still new and clean.  Dark colors and somewhat dim lighting make for an intimate meal even when the bright sun is shining in through the window overlooking Liberty Avenue.\\n\\nThe service was great, almost too attentive.  We had our waters filled every time we took a sip.  Our meals came quickly, almost too quick, making us think too much prep work is done.  The food was really good though.  We each got a bowl of soup.  The wife got the Tom Yum with Shrimp.  It was hot and sour in a good way.  There were three nice sized shrimp in the broth and tasted fresh.  I got the Tom Kha with shrimp, which was excellent.  The coconut broth was smooth and delicious.  I always enjoy this dish and make sure I try it everywhere.  Thai Cuisine balanced this soup very well.  We then shared a massive plate of Pad Thai with veggies and tofu.  The pad thai was good, but not great.  The portion was huge, definitely shareable especially after eating a bowl of soup.  I wasn't impressed however with the amount of veggies in the dish or the amount of sauce.  It lacked both and might get to great with a bit more of each.  Also, the veggies seemed wilted and not really fresh.  \\n\\nSo, in short.

Portions are sufficient for a solid meal and very reasonably priced.\\n\\nI might venture and say that this is one of the best Thai places in Pittsburgh, but I know that's highly debated here.

That\\'s a dish we hardly ever get when its just the two of us, because it can be a bit generic, a safe choice for those that don\\'t know or really like Thai food.  But it IS the national dish of a truly world-class cuisine, and given what they do with the green curry, we thought, \"I bet it\\'s really something special\"\\n\\nAs we were leaving, the owner thanked us for coming, and as we discussed the meal a bit she said \"Oh, you have to try the Pad Thai!  The best in the city!\"  I bet that\\'s true, and can\\'t wait to have another dish that\\'s usually a bit of a yawn, turn out to be a real surprise in the hands of this great Thai restaurant.'],\n",

I've walked by this place so many times, and I'm glad I finally made plans to eat here. \\n\\nWhen it comes to Thai food, I'm a bit of a broken record. I love Pad Sew and Pad Thai dishes, and typically insist the table gets at least one. Our table ordered the Pad See Ew, a calamari special, and I ordered a bowl of the Tom Yum Soup. \\n\\nThe Pad See Ew was delicious, and felt like the perfect comfort food on a colder evening. We ordered it with veggies, and they were perfectly cooked--not too soggy, but also not too crunchy. I was pleasantly surprised by the Thai calamari we had, it wasn't something I'd typically order at a Thai place, but the sauce was awesome, and the little fried calamari's rivaled that of the best Italian places. The Tom Yum soup is soon to be my new go to dish. Once again, it has that feeling of comfort food. Judging on the proximity of this place to my house, I can tell I will be ordering this for take out often. \\n\\nWe did something very out of character for the group and ordered dessert after eating. I'm not a sweets girl, but EVERYONE SHOULD TRY THE DESSERT HERE. I can't recommend the dessert rice dishes more, they were spectacular. We had one with rice and mango--it's almost like a sweet risotto. Their desserts rotate on a seasonal basis, but they typically will have a rice one on the menu. It's a unique flavor that can't be missed.\\n\\nI'm sure I will be back again soon with a bottle of wine (BYOB), and an empty stomach.\"],\n",

I usually get the veggie variation (loaded up with silky smooth tofu and tons of veggies!) but any variation is just as wonderful. \\n\\nI just returned home from a trip to Thai Cuisine with some friends. The environment is comforting and warm. I love the lights strewn along the windows! They just add to the coziness of the place. After getting the obligatory veggie tom kha soup, I got the green curry with shrimp. Others in my party got the yellow curry and the panang curry and everyone was pleased with their choices.

Whine and ye shall receive.\\n\\nAfter perusing the menu, we decide to take out some chicken pad thai and another dish called \"three flavored chicken.\" Both solid choices. The pad thai portion was huge and chock full of the good stuff (they did not skimp on the meat or veggies in here!)  The sauce was flavorful and plentiful, yet light...not overly thick, oily, or sticky, as some pad thai sauces can be. The \"three flavored chicken\" was also tasty with its crispy, breaded chunks of white meat chicken. The sauce was interesting and unlike anything I\\'ve ever had before. Despite its name, I really only tasted two flavors that dominated the sauce -- vinegar (sour) and sugar (sweet). It could have used some spice to round it out, but even so, it was still delicious. I do wish it had some broccoli or other vegetable in it so I at least felt a little less guilty about eating copious amounts of fried chicken chunks :)  And overall, for our tastes, both dishes definitely could have kicked up the spice intensity. We had ordered both at a level 8, and as I said, I couldn\\'t really detect any spice at all. So if that was an 8, next time I\\'ll probably order a 33. :)\\n\\nOverall, this is very yummy Thai food.

Authentic or not it had that red spicy edge that I prefer in Pad Thai, and I couldn't get enough of it! Most Pad Thai around here is a sweet brown sauce, which is fine but not as complex. The Thai place near my mother's house makes their Pad Thai the way I like it, and I've been on an unofficial hunt to track down a similar version of the dish nearer to where I live. The hunt is now over! The portions here are a bit smaller for the higher price point, but the taste and quality balances it out very well.

We always went for wing night, and the wings were very large and quite tasty. My favorite sauce was the honey jalapeno. While the wings were decent and cheap for the size, I had from day one thought the beers were a bit overpriced for the type of bar and location.  The wings kept me coming back, and they were cheap, so I didn\\'t mind paying a little bit more for a few beers. As time went on, the menu seemed to go through a few changes...a few less items, and higher prices, and severely decreased portion sizes. I understand that as with anything, prices are always going to go up, but at the same time, the quality should remain the same or get better! This was not the case here, after giving them a few tries, I gave up. On my last few visits the food was absolutely awful, the portions were minuscule, and overall overpriced. They also did away with the 50 cent wing night. It always seemed that all the owner was concerned with was the almighty dollar. I tried the the corned beef sandwich just after St. Patty\\'s day last year, and the corned beef was almost all fat, it was so bad that they took the sandwich and had me order a new item from the menu. After that I tried the fish and chips around lent, and what a joke it was! You got potato chips ( not home made), and a few tiny pieces of fish that were almost all breading. All of the \"specials\" that they have, whether they are food or drink, are not worth the prices that this place seems to think that they are. All of their \"special\" prices are what most other places have as their regular everyday prices!

It used to be my favorite and i would come once a week back in the day. This salad was so nasty...they forgot the cheese...forgot the salsa and sour cream...it was disgusting.

Their homemade chips are awesome, esp dipped in their ranch dressing! Mykonos salad is another favorite.  Anyway, they had their New Years specials available so my husband and I decided to indulge...filet mignon and lobster tail! Was delicious and cooked perfect.  Served with asparagus and twice baked potatoes..Yum!  Also came with a salad.  Was an excellent early New Years dinner:-)'],\n",

       "  u\"yay! there's still hope for this place!!! we were worried, but we went to the wine dinner last thursday, & it was marvelous! \\nwe've been going here pretty much since it opened, like 20ish years. it was a fantastic spot-friendly, helpful staff, great food, good prices. something happened a few years back. some blamed the loss of chefs(they went through quite a few for a while.). there was also a change in management. lou, the owner, wants to retire. he seems to have given the reins over to his nephew chris. you know the saying-when the cat's away the mice will play? it SEEMS as though he doesn't command the same respect or drive, as lou. hopefully, he'll get it right. \\nbut they have a new chef, & he seems to be the ticket right now. he's supposed to be friends with chef jamie from season 5 top chef. he came from san diego & plans on staying here in pgh. for a while.\\nthe getaway has a wine dinner about 4 times a year. this 1 was called-classic cuisine from around the world. 6 courses with paired wines for $75/person. the wine alone doesn't seem to be covered with that price!!! the course servings were huge & the wines were plentiful. everyone rolled out of there afterwards!!! the chef & the  speaker from majestic wine & spirits, kevin, spoke about each course & wine.\\nthe 1st course was lobster & crab bisque with a georges duboeuf macon village. the pieces of crab & lobster were perfectly cooked, not over done.\\nthe 2nd course was heirloom tomato & fresh mozzerella bruschetta with piccini chianti docg. beautiful tomatoes in vibrant colors & soft cheese piled on top of a piece of toast, sprinkled with balsamic. the wine was a wonderful match.\\nthe 3rd course was a thai chicken burrito served with a ste. chapelle winemaker series riesling. we were nervous about a riesling, but what a great counter to the burrito! it tasted so good!!!  in fact, i see they put the burrito on the menu! good choice!\\nthe 4th course was a fresh grilled halibut with a yellow tomato basil sauce, a salad of watercress, feta & strawberries in a champagne vinaigrette with grilled asparagus, paired with 99 vines pinot noir. i am usually not big on fish, but this fish was crazy good! i was doing my dance, just kinda slow. i was actually getting full & i can eat most people under the table!!! plus, there were still 2 more courses!!! \\nthe 5th course was a beef wellington with a garnacha de fuego. omg!!! a welly????  the goose pate was so smooth, tasty. the wine was definitely worth it!!! YUM!!!  we bought a bottle the next day. we'll probably empty out the state store!!!\\nfinally, the 6th course! dessert!!! what i've been waiting for through the whole meal!!! i had 1 tinsy space left for it! good thing too!!! individual chocolate pecan pies with caramel sauce, ganache  & whipped cream with chocovine wine. it was all so worth the pain i felt from being too full!!! the chocovine wine comes in several flavors. it's like a yoohoo for adults!!! we also bought a bottle of that, in espresso flavor, when we went to the state store! (side note- it's also delish with the bailey's irish cream cake from signature desserts!!!)\\ni would suggest that they give the entire menu when they advertize. most people want to know what they're paying for, especially for that kind of money. the next 1 is the end of may. i'm already counting the days! if you're looking for a fantasic evening out with excellant food, this is the ticket! i hope that this is just the tip of new things to come!!!\"],\n",

I was expecting (due to the negative reviews) a real s***hole, but upon entering, the decor is actually very pleasant.  It does not have that typical bar, rundown, needs updating appearance.  And from what I was able to observe, they try to keep it clean; even the Men's bathroom was clean.  The servers were not just wiping the tables clean, either.  They were spraying them with sanitizer and THEN wiping them.\\nOn to the food.  As I said, it was lunchtime, and they had a pretty good crowd for lunch.  It took a while for our server to get to us, but once she did, the service was excellent.  Prompt drink service and didn't have to ASK for refills.  She kept our glasses full.  Everyone enjoyed their food (a burger, club sandwich, and 2 different salads).  Not only did the food TASTE good, the presentation was excellent as well.  Nobody in our party ordered dessert; we were all too full.  They DO have a dessert case with some scrumptious looking selections, though.\\nWe all agreed we would return to The Getaway Cafe.\\nAs I said before, all of the negative reviews of this place made me a bit skeptical.\\nI am glad we checked it out anyways.\\nBased on the fact that my daughter lives in this neighborhood now, we WILL return.  And when I do, I will update this review.  If the food/service/decor changes, so will the rating.  Based on 1 visit, though, I was impressed.\\nOh, one more thing.  I saw several complaints in previous reviews about this place being overpriced.  I'd say they are about average.  The days of the $5 hamburger are about gone.  This is 2013.  While they may be a buck or two higher than some places, our bill for lunch for a party of 4 (drinks included, tax included) was $44.  Considering that a value meal at McDonald's is about $6 now, that's not too bad.\"],\n",

I have been mostly underwhelmed by the food,except for their desserts which are perfection.  They have a very ambitious menu which perhaps does not give the cooks time enough to really focus on making fewer items really well. Sometimes the dinners are good, sometimes they are not. The salads are good.  I would only go there to meet a friend for a drink or attend an event that you are invited to, going there as dinner date is a real gamble, even if you do have a groupon.'],\n",

       "  u'My boyfriend and I stopped into the Getaway last night to catch the last two periods of the Pens vs. Kings game. We arrived around 7:30 and it wasn\\'t crowded so we took a couple of seats at the bar. Rose, the bartender, was quick to ask us what we wanted to drink. Of course I chose a Southern Tier 2X IPA and he chose a Yuengling, Rose knew all of her regulars and was friendly with everyone. The owners were actually sitting at the bar at the same time and seemed to know most of the regulars as well. For my meal, I ordered the getaway signature wrap (romaine lettuce, tomatoes, walnuts, diced chicken, mandarin oranges and feta cheese, drizzled with balsamic dressing). I asked for no walnuts and a nice surprise as well was the fact that there were craisins in the wrap too. With just the right amount of balsalmic spread throughout the wrap, this was very tasty. I chose fries as my side and those were good as well. My boyfriend has eaten here several times and said the wings (particularly the cajun) are tasty as is the quesadilla (which is so huge you can order just a half), and the Reuben, however, last night he chose the steak hoagie (Thin sliced grilled sirloin and provolone \\ncheese on a toasted 8\" hoagie roll with lettuce and tomatoes). He said it was tasty and he would order it again. Their desserts are from Signature desserts and they all looked delicious! We chose the pumpkin cheesecake. It had just the right amount of pumpkin flavor and was not overpowering. A very tasty seasonal treat! It\\'s hard to find a combination of good service and good food and we found it here so we will be back in the future.'],\n",

The chips were homemade and crisp-kettle cooked how I prefer them. For apps our table got cajun wings (I did not try these) and a Buffalo chicken pita pizza ( grilled chicken set atop pita bread with Buffalo sauce and ranch dressing) and the pita pizza was 4 pieces so it could easily be a full meal too-which is exactly what I think I'll do next visit. It wasn't overly hot and the ranch definitely helped tone that down. Service, as usual, was stellar so will be returning soon!\"],\n",

When I said \"no tomatoes\" the waitress offered cucumbers instead. I asked for Blue Cheese Dressing. When the salad came out it was big. I only ate 1/3 of it. Everything was crisp and fresh. I believe the dressing was homemade. \\nMy youngest son ordered Chicken Strips and fries. There was a whole lot of chicken!!  It was golden brown and crispy. The coating was light and was a good proportion to the chicken. The fries were excellent. All 3 of is kept eating them. \\nMy oldest son ordered a gyro salad. It had a lot of gyro meat and he said the dressing was really good. It looked really good!  \\nSo, good food, mediocre service and just ignore the decor.

So good, I wanted to place a pick up order that a friend would get and bring to a party I was having.\\n\\nAt noon on a Friday I called Getaway to place an order for wings. \\n\\n1) When I asked how many wings were in an order I was placed on hold so the hostess could get a manager to answer my question. (Ok)\\n2) After deciding to get a bucket I asked to pre-pay so that my friend would only need to pick up and go, I was put on hold again while the Manager got ANOTHER manager who knew how to run as credit card payment, (really?)\\n3) I hung up after providing all my card info and letting them know the order would be picked up at 4pm.  When my friend got there, no one had any idea about the order and said that didn't have it, and that the earlier manager hadn't left any note. I told my friend to forget about it. (You've got to bee kidding)\\n4) On the way out they stop her to say that the kitchen did indeed have the order made. GREAT! Except they still didn't know anything about a payment and she would have to pay for the order. (Oh, heck no!)\\n\\nThis was after already being there for 20 min and the wait staff were not remotely apologetic.  Not only had they failed to check with the kitchen in that time, but they expected double payment.  So they kept their wings and my card was still charged.  When I called on Monday to speak with a manager about the charge, I was told that none were there and they weren't sure when he'd arrive.  I called twice and had zero apology, help, or resolution.\"],\n",

       "  u'Awful service. \\n\\nWe don\\'t come here often but have always had decent experiences. Good food, not quite the value of Armstrong\\'s but a closer drive. Upon hearing they were under new ownership, we decided to take the family for dinner. \\n\\nWe walked in and were \"greeted\" coldly by a server. Not a great start but we gave it a pass not knowing what she may have going on. We were seated and asked for our drink order. Drinks came fast but that was it. Once our orders we taken it was all down hill.\\n\\nThe kids\\' food came quickly as was decent. Once we received it, my son decided that he wanted a ginger ale. I told him to wait until the waitress came back and we would order one. She never did. \\n\\nOnce we started serving the kids, we realized that we didn\\'t have napkins or silverware. We tried to catch the attention of another waitress but could not. The kids could eat their pizza and quesadilla with their hands but we needed napkins. My wife ended up going to the bathroom for paper towels. \\n\\nIt became comical after 15 or 20 minutes when my boys were done eating and our steak salad and steak hoagie did not come out. At that point, the table behind us caught another waitress walking by, \"We\\'ve been waiting for 15 minutes for our check.\" We weren\\'t the only ones forgotten here. We couldn\\'t even ask for our son\\'s ginger ale or silverware for the table because nobody stopped by to check on us and our waitress was missing for over 20 minutes.\\n\\nWhen our food finally came out, we had been there for almost an hour. The kids were done eating so I asked if she could wrap it up. \"I\\'ll bring you some boxes.\" Seriously? I could almost understand that response if we were troublesome. We didn\\'t have the opportunity. In the hour that we had been there, the only contact with the staff was being seated, ordering, and receiving drinks and half of our food. The few touches we did have were decidedly negative.\\n\\nAs I sat there packing up my own food while my family got their coats on, I decided to write this review. What an awful experience. \\n\\nThe food was just OK. The quesadilla had bacon in it. Fine I guess but just call it a chicken bacon ranch quesadilla and serve ranch dressing instead of sour cream. Otherwise, just make a decent quesadilla. The kids pizza was fine. The steak salad tasted fine at our kitchen table. The steak was the best part. The rest was mostly head lettuce with a few tomatoes and cucumbers with shredded cheese on top. (Go to Armstrong\\'s if you want to have it done right.) My steak hoagie was actually two mini sandwiches. They soaked the bread in butter making a fat pill even bigger. I wouldn\\'t recommend it. Bellisario\\'s across the street does it way better. The fries were fine.\\n\\nThey were busy but the general atmosphere, lack of service, general lack of caring makes this place the worst restaurant experience that we have had in a long time.'],\n",

       "  u'This is a dive.  A true dive.  The lack of pretentiousness and extraneous decor in the building are mirrored in the food that you get here.  I would recommend staying away during popular hours due to the fact that the parking is somewhat difficult -- the scant parking is on the side of the building and on the side of the road going up the steep hill.  \\n\\nIt really doesn\\'t matter if you will be dining in or carrying out, you need to walk to the counter first to place your order.  If you have more than one person in your group, all the better since they can be on the look-out for a coveted table.  Once you order, pay for it.  On my first time here, I sat down and waited to be served -- they won\\'t come.  I then ordered at the counter and was given the option of paying before or after the meal and I chose after -- the people making the food will assume you haven\\'t arrived and will go slow in the preparation, PAY!\\n\\nWith the niceties out of the way, you can focus on finding a table or just sit back and relax if someone in your crew already found one.  I have been here twice already and these people just don\\'t stop.  It is a well-greased assembly line that only lets you down if you don\\'t follow the proper path (look at the above paragraph).  Both times I contented myself to watch the large numbers of people that enter through this pizza parlours doors while we waited on our order:\\n\\nFirst Trip only:\\nGarlic bread\\nHot wings\\n\\nBoth Trips:\\nMeatballs (x2) and red sauce\\nPepperoni Pizza with Extra Cheese (12\" - 8 cut)\\n\\nThe meatballs, wings, and bread came out rather quickly.  The garlic bread was nothing special, just a loaf brushed with a garlic oil and warmed.  Very simple, but somewhat weak in the garlic department.  The buffalo wings were good.  They were not hot/piquant; but they actually had good flavor and that is really what counts.  They were slightly more acidic than many of the wings that I have had in the area and that went well with a little bit of blue cheese.  The meatballs were about the size of a racketball.  Very little to no seasoning in both the sauce and the meatballs.  I was quite surprised to find that I enjoyed them.  The small number of ingredients that go into making this simple sauce and meatball had to be in proper proportion each time to get that wonderful flavor -- so far they are batting 2/2.  \\n\\nOur pizza arrived steaming hot and smelling wonderful.  I could tell from the small bits of brown that were beginning in the cheese that the pizza had been cooked fully and to the proper temperature.  There is nothing worse than a pizza that is pulled too soon.  I ate my first piece and was amazed at the flavors.  The pizza, overall, had a sweet undertone.  As I started on my second piece, I began to take more note of the flavors.  The crust had a slightly sweet flavor, was a tad doughy/soft, but was super thin and had a very good flavor.  The sauce was also sweet; it tasted like the sauce that came with the meatballs.  Tasting the pepperoni, again there was this sweet undertone to it.  \\n\\nI must say, I am not usually a fan of sweet foods, but this wasn\\'t unnaturally sweet and it was tasting good.  What amazed me the most was the near-perfect execution of the pizza with so few ingredients and none of the usual and stereotypical Italian seasonings.  Yeah, I enjoyed this pizza.  It is definitely the best I have had in Pittsburgh.  I will be returning for my pizza fix again and again and again...  \\n\\nThey only accept cash, if you have none there is a convenient ATM near the singles/kiddie bar.  They are open until 3am on the weekends, so if you get a late night hankering for pizza you are in luck.  Just be advised you will have to then battle the post-bar crowd.\\n\\nNOTE:  If you must have the Italian seasoning, you won\\'t like this pizza.  Also, be careful of ordering too many toppings or extra cheese as the crust is so thin and has a hard time holding it up -- not an issue if you eat with a fork.'],\n",

       "  u\"When I heard about the slightly sweet sauce served on a Fiori's Pizza, I was doubtful about whether or not this would be a place for me. I have to say overall I liked it- but with a few caveats.\\n\\nParking stinks.  Don't bother eating in, just get take out. Grab a friend, have them drive and run in to pick up your pie. My quick bite of pizza took over two hours from finding a parking space, standing in line to order, waiting for my pizza to be made, getting a table with said pizza (there is very limited seating for eating in), eating and finally wriggling past the other waiting people to get out to search for the car. The place is CASH ONLY, no credit cards so make sure you got a twenty to buy your pie. (Fortunately they have an ATM on site but the fees!)\\n\\nAll my complaints aside, I did enjoy my pizza. The sweetness of the sauce was balanced by the saltiness of the olives they exuberantly provided on my pizza. The crowd of people in there provided for a quite interesting people-watching experience. The slices of pizza were unevenly divided and my eating companions were quick to grab what might have been fold-able slices, but I feel like folding was a possibility for the crust.\\n\\nOverall, I'd go back.\"],\n",

       "  u\"I have to admit, I've never physically been inside Fiori's, but I've had their pizza several times. In a word: forgettable.\\n\\nThe last take-out pie we got was less than pleasing to the eye. All the cheese was on half the pie. The onions were diced - an interesting choice - and I actually liked that they were raw. The green peppers seemed to have been cut willy nilly, but that's OK. It's not 5-star, it's pizza. The pizza has a sweet taste to it, and I can't can't if it's the sauce or the dough, but I suspect the former. \\n\\nOverall, I'd eat it again, but wouldn't go out of my way. I suspect it would be really delicious cold, for breakfast.\"],\n",

       "  u\"It was late and on the way home with nothing at home to eat.  Stopped by Fiori's, haven't been there in years.  Yes, it was crowded but got a table and ordered pizza and wings.  \\n\\nThe pizza was hard to chew the crust was hard, the cheese was too!  The pizza was just sweet without much other taste, almost like ketchup!  Definitely not a fan of sweet pizza...I don't know why it is so popular but most people tend to like sweet food and drinks...but not me...I want some flavors and spice!\\n\\nThe wings were so average....not anything I would order again....my son ate one and said he was done...amazing!\\n\\nI know! I know! this place is popular, but it is just is not for me!\"],\n",

       "  u\"My stepfather-in-law gave me sage advice about finding good pizza. If you don't know the pizza in an area, look for the dirtiest, rundown place you can find, and you'll find the best pizza in town. The thinking behind that is, if the place looks that bad but is still in busines, then there is a reason they're still in business. And in my experiences, it's almost always true.\\n\\nFiori's is a dive (in a good way)- the inside looks like it was put together in the '70's, and the staff isn't always the friendliest. Forget about parking- there are three spots on the side of the building and perilious street parking on the hill. The later in the evening you go, the busier the dining room. My suggestion is don't eat here- you're only asking for drama.\\n\\nBut then you get home with that steaming pie, and all the parking nonsense, questionable customer service, and wait in line vanishes as you're enveloped in cheesey, meaty goodness. The pizzas are big, there are a ton of toppings, and the sauce is sweet in a good way. My suggestion is try their white pizza, which I think rivals the ones I've had in New York. I get mine with ricotta cheese, mushrooms, and meatballs- I'm drooling just thinking about it. I also suggest you try their italian hoagie- big, lots of meat, good dressing, and toasted in a crunchy way- my favorite in Pittsburgh.\"],\n",

       "  u\"We stopped at Fiori's after a late night walking around the inclines in Pittsburgh--although it is no where near the inclines.  We decided to grab a large pizza to fix our hunger and were not disappointed.\\n\\nFiori's feels like a place out of a Ben Afflack movie--the neighborhood joint where everyone knows each other.  In our half an hour there, I must have seen 8 different chance occurrences between people in town.\\n\\nOnto the pizza!  We got a 16 inch pie for just over 12 dollars!  Thin crust that was crispy, not overly cheesy or saucy--although the sauce did have a distinct sweet flavor.  Baked to perfection--lightly golden brown.  Enjoyable flavor!  If you have been to Grimaldi's in Brooklyn, it's a similar style with a different taste.  \\n\\nOverall: the pizza is good, atmosphere is easy! Don't listen to the haters, although parking is a pain.\"],\n",

       "  u\"A friend of mine calls this the best pizza in Pittsburgh.  I disagree, but it's definitely up there with some of the best.  Maybe top three?\\n\\nEverything was quick, and the pizza was good.  Sadly, there's not much of a story here, or any room to expand.  Therefore, a short review.  \\n\\nOh yeah, holy crap steep hill for parking on! You could probably park elsewhere, though... I didn't know what I was doing, so I climbed the hill a bit and parked in that neighborhood.\"],\n",

This is not authnetic Italian pizza.  In my opinion, is the best American/ Italian pizza in the Burgh (because of its sweet sauce).  There Italian Hoagie is great as well.   Most people havent tried their pasta  which is remarkable good for a pizza joint.\\n\\n3) Have been eating here since I was 5 years old.

I hope the owner or general manager reads this. And think the health department should too.\\n\\nService is mediocre and slow. consistently. Waitress was ok in attitude.\\n\\nAfter our soup starter (good french onion soup) we waited and waited and waited and waited for our mains. Noticing us staring at her, waitress stopped by, went into kitchen, came back and said we were next. my watch said 8:31. Then her manager came by and argued with me and said we were next, then at 8:52pm the horrible food finally arrived. That\\'s 21 minutes to be next. In that time we watched 4 tables turn from being seated to drinks to mains to check down while we waited for our main. \\n\\nManager embarrassed himself. Said they were busy and working our food and he had checked and would come soon. I told him about the 4 tables turning and he said no they didn\\'t. then I said I used to manage restaurants and know what customer service and ticket times are and he challenged me and said no I didn;t and I had no idea what I was talking about. What an idiot! First rule of restaurant business is the customer is always right.\\n\\nThen the food arrived. How hard is it to do chicken marsala with mushrooms, seriously? It was two soggy fried chicken tenders from the deep fryer (not pan sauteed) over a bowl of bowtie pasta with shrooms and a sauce. While the sauce did have some marsala in it, it was full of sour cream and tasted like stroganoff and a little funny. The Penne ala vodka was sauteed canned tomatoes and no flavor. We were so hungry we ate most and left.\\n\\n1 hour later I was sick on the side of the road from the dinner and still feel really rough this morning.'"
